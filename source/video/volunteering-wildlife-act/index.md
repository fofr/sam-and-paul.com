My time with [Wildlife Act](http://wildlifeact.com/) is over. [4 weeks in North Island, Seychelles](http://localhost:4000/2016/08/north-island-seychelles/), which feels so long ago. [2 weeks in iMfolozi](/2016/09/imfolozi-south-africa/), [2 in Tembe](/2016/09/tembe-elephant-park/), 2 in Mkhuze and now the last 2 in ZRR. Each reserve and monitor is different, each with a different focus, each relentlessly dedicated to the conservation and protection of endangered species.

Itâ€™s been a truly life changing experience; rewarding, exciting, thrilling, tiring, joyful and painful. I made so many friends and laughed so many times. I worked hard, I learnt the smell of death, I discovered the incredibly tough problems conservation deals with every day; poaching, climate change, habitat destruction, lack of space, lack of corridors, genetic diversity and disease. At times they feel insurmountable, but every life saved, every life protected, is a victory.

[Wildlife Act](http://wildlifeact.com/), along with the wild dog advisory group, are changing the fortunes of the wild dogs; they work tirelessly to protect them, to manage the gene pool, to find them safe and suitable homes, to convince reserves to house them, to raise awareness of them; they do the hard work to keep their numbers growing. I am so thankful to have been part of that, to have contributed my time and money. May the work continue, and may the dogs thrive.
