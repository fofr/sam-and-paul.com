## Day 7 – A day of rest

Spending 12 hours a day on the back of a truck isn’t good for the back. A jolt jarred some muscles and I needed a break from all the driving. The Toyota truck needed a service, Kelsey and the girls headed to Hluhluwe for the day, while Jannes and I stayed home. We wrote blogs, slept, tagged photos and did admin work, while they were away.

I was sad to miss the puppies they saw on the road, Alfie’s pack had left them there while out hunting. I wasn't so sad to have missed the two angry elephants they encountered, both of which were close and threatened to charge.

## Day 8 – Camera traps

Today was a little different. At 6am we headed out to scan for cheetahs and to change the camera traps. Scattered throughout the park are cameras mounted on tree stumps, they are motion activated and save photos to an SD card. Every so often volunteers go out to them to swap out the SD cards and change the batteries. This means leaving the safety of the vehicle.

When walking in the bush you walk in single file, with the leader at the front – if anything happens, it happens to them. If we bumped a lion we'd need to stand our ground, we didn’t. Most of the cameras are close to the road, some a couple of metres, others in sight of the truck; one was a short trek, up and over some dirt hills. We were all nervous. Below us the ground was dry, the dirt crusty, beside us we saw termite mounds and warthog holes, a little porcupine burrow too.

Changing the camera is easy; unlock the case, check the number of photos taken, swap out the memory cards, swap out the batteries, reset the time and date, take a test photo, and hey presto. "Trap is clean". Sometimes things do climb up into the camera casing, nasty things like spiders and scorpions, when I opened one a gecko came scuttling out and almost gave me a heart attack. Others keep watch.

One camera trap took us out through dusty bush, our surroundings were orange and desert-like, a secretarybird strutted by – searching for snakes, a lilac breasted roller flew across, dazzling us with its colours, a bateleur flew high above us.

The trail took us to a management road which runs along the border-fence. The border prompted talk of poachers, poaching prevention techniques, supply chains, the ugliness of rhino horn poaching, corruption, convictions and shootings. It’s all devastating. The fence isn’t strong enough to stop elephants. We pass an old rhino skin, and a banded mongoose skips away from us. Back on public roads, we stop at a riverbed viewpoint and drink coffee.

### Finding cheetah CF13

When we’re done with the last trap we switch our attention to CF13. Throughout the day we'd been pinging her signal, getting a rough location. Now we were close, the camera was besides a cheetah scent-marking tree and CF13 was nearby. From up on the hill we looked down into the valley to find her, some impala looked nervous, on the opposite side was movement – our cheetah was heading toward them, and us. Her belly looked swollen, she must be pregnant.

The impala sprint away, and CF13 disappears into the valley. We try to pinpoint her but she’s moving away from us now. We change positions and get another strong signal, but frustratingly she doesn’t reappear.

It’s a similar story with Bhejie’s pack in the evening. The signal besides their den is hard to interpret, it's in a valley, their den is beneath rocks (seen in a photo taken from a heli’); it bounces a lot – holding up the antenna and keeping it still, you can hear the changing intensity of the beeps. Determining when they are actually leaving is almost impossible. Tonight we learnt this too late.

We rushed up and over the hill on okhulho loop and tried to follow their signal. Four southern ground hornbills took to the sky as we rattled by, a crowned lapwing disappears when it lands – perfect camouflage. No dogs though. We missed them.

## Day 9 – Birdwatching and elephant herds

Today it’s my turn to scan, and we’re on the road early looking for Alfie’s pack. The signal takes us across the park, over the river and up towards where we’d spotted them before. Hopefully we might see puppies again. But the short range signal from the telemetry puts them in a place hard to get to; for them they can simply cross the river and carry on, for us it's a 20 minute drive. Kelsey deliberates about which way to go, and which side of the river to put us. We head back, at speed, back over the bridge, and taking a quick right turn, down towards Nselweni lodge.

It’s a camp and everyone is sleeping, so we hush up and head to a viewpoint that overlooks the river. The signal is strong, but we can't see them. As we'd do in the truck, we wait it out. A perfect opportunity for early morning birdwatching, as well as coffee and rusks, of course. From the rickety wooden lookout point I spot birds that get me excited; trumpeter hornbills, crowned hornbills, brown-hooded kingfishers, black-collared barbets, fiscals, drongos, geese and mousebirds, and my favourite, an african paradise flycatcher.

In the rainy season the river would fill up more, and in the wet pools you’d see hippo. We don't know where they disappear to when the river is dry, as it was today. Buffalo were sleeping in the riverbed.

Every now and then we scan again to see if the dog’s signal has moved. Out of nowhere we spot one, coming over the hill, it’s sprinting into the distance – to the water for a drink. There’s another too, it does the same, and they both soon disappear. Shortly we see spooked nyala, running from something, and there’s a hyena call, but we catch no further glimpse of the pack.

### Finding ellies

The morning dog session finished early, but rather than go back we begin to scan for elephant breeding herds. We'd passed some ‘ellies’ on the road, on our way to the dogs. "Shall we scan for elephants?", Kelsey asked. Claire looked nervous, but I point the antenna, find a direction and we head for BH331.

There are signs of them, trees knocked down, a lingering smell, but at the end of the road – a camp, we see no sign of them. We scan again but give up and head back. But on the same road, we now found an elephant, a few of them were grazing by the roadside. We assume it's BH332, but when I scan again it's a different herd, BH178. On the road beside us we also see fresh lion tracks, we scan for prides but don't find any.

There are three females around us, and a youngster feeding from its mother. A female nearby looks agitated, she’s swinging her trunk, we put down the telemetry and stay quiet – forgetting about the lions, we don't want the elephant to charge us in this tight space. As a precaution we begin edging forward.

Out of nowhere the breeding herd appears, led by the largest female elephant - the collared one we'd picked up with our scans. She’s walking fast, practically running, trunk swaying, ears flapping and she's leading over 50 elephants through the forest, young and old rush by us – all rushing through, almost a stampede. We watch in awe as they all cross right behind us. As their path bottlenecks they spread out to get across.

"One is coming, Kelsey, Kelsey, Kelsey, one is coming, behind" – Philippine, alarmed by the beast heading quickly our way, out of the thicket, we pull forward and we’re clear, it can cross, it trumpets at us as it walks on by. For the remainder of our trip, "Kelsey, Kelsey, Kelsey" became a catchphrase for us, it should be Kelsey’s ringtone.

Away from the lions, in the mid-morning sunshine, we stopped by the river viewpoint. Some cars had gathered there, down in the basin we could see some white rhino, a lone elephant bull, a sleeping male lion and in the shade nearby, a collared female. These two must be mating, and they’re probably the ones that left those tracks we'd seen. The lions were too far and too sleepy to keep me interested, instead I watched the white-fronted bee-eaters.

### Cheetahs and Lions

The afternoon session was a little different, we headed out to find cheetah and lion. Philippine sat upfront because it was cold and cloudy. We split into teams; left and right; points awarded for different animals, certain animals get more, like lions – 10 points and warthogs – 3 points, a herd of impala – 1 point.

We scanned for HIP636, the youngster and the female, and found them remarkably quickly, sat just away from the road again. Kelsey’s team got a very quick lead that we could never beat, no matter how many impala we found. The lions were sleeping, we left them in search of CF13; we saw many white rhino, warthogs, and even some crested guineafowl, but no cheetah. Philippine reluctantly conceded defeat to Kelsey, they were over 40 points ahead and only a black rhino would catch us up, and we stopped to watch the sun go down – a beautiful African sunset against the umbrella acacias.

Back at camp Jannes cooked us his impressive rice and venison stew, and over dinner we listened out for nearby lion calls.
