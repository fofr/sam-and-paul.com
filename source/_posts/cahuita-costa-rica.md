## London to Cahuita, via San Jose and Houston

From London Heathrow we travelled to Cahuita, on Costa Rica’s Atlantic coast, it’s own small slice of the Caribbean and the first stop on our two week trip around the Latin American country. Like our China trip we booked through [Rickshaw travel](https://www.rickshawtravel.co.uk/central-america/costa-rica/); too tired with work we wanted to avoid the stress of handling it all ourselves. Many of the arrangements were made by [Ecole Travel](http://www.ecoletravel.com/), and all our non-airport transfers would be with the excellent [Interbus](https://www.interbusonline.com/).

First an 11 hour flight to Houston, where we picked up some NASA memorabilia, then a 4 hour one to San Jose. We arrived in the dark, our long haul flight landed at 9pm. Door to door it was 23 hours and we were exhausted. After meeting our pickup we had to wait for the transfer, an accident between a truck and a train had caused travel chaos in San Jose, and it took longer than normal to crawl through the city’s bustling Friday night.

Our stop over in San Jose was at Le Bergerac, a small oasis in town, basic rooms with a bit of a garden – behind a locked gate. We were in room 16, next to the fountain they don't turn off. Despite the jet lag neither of us slept well, and we were up again at 6am for breakfast and an early checkout.

The minibus from San Jose to Cahuita took 5 hours, about 200km. We headed south out of San Jose, where the landscape was full of beautiful blossoming trees; pink and orange flowers covered the hillsides. We climbed up and over Turrialba and the roads became winding and mountainous. Vultures circled high above, over the sugar cane and banana plantations, our views were spectacular. From Siquirres the roads flattened out and were full of trucks transporting temperature-controlled containers packed with bananas. Maersk container depots were everywhere. The final stretch hugged the sea, and the bumpy unpaved road along Playa Negra brought us to our hotel, Atlantida lodge. That bumpy pot-holed road is the “Tico” norm.

## Atlantida Lodge

A 10 minute walk from town, on the edge of Playa Negra – a black sand beach with crashing waves and coconut trees – sits [Atlantida Lodge](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g309262-d308600-Reviews-Atlantida_Lodge-Cahuita_Province_of_Limon.html), our accommodation for the next 3 nights.

Rooms are sparse and simple; comfortable beds, tiled floors, nets and shutters rather than glass windows, ceiling fans that spin dangerously fast (no aircon), a shower that feels like it’s outside, a couple of oil paintings depicting local wildlife adorn the walls. The sounds of the tropics pervade the walls, chirping bugs and squawking geckos fill the room at night, in the morning you can’t help but be woken by the birds. It’s best to keep the shutters wide open, so that air can flow and the room can keep cool; temperatures of 29C make it somewhat hot.

Surrounding the rooms is a luscious tropical garden. Heliconia, Angel’s Trumpets, ginger flowers, hibiscus and maraca plants; a cornucopia of pleasures for birds; brightly coloured birds with brilliant songs were everywhere, over time we’d come to know their names, for now we were in awe. A hummingbird flitted about, chirping, guarding its territory, hovering for us to admire but always camera shy. Staff told us that sloths occasionally sleep in the trees above, and at night we’ll see some of Costa Rica’s infamous poisonous frogs.

There’s a _slightly_ salt water pool and bar, where staff were painting their uncomfortable concrete sun beds, an abandoned Angry Birds inflatable ball bobbled on the water’s surface.

At reception we arrived just in time to grab some lunch; a Hawaiian pizza and Caribbean chicken. Most of the day was then spent recuperating, relaxing and enjoying our surroundings. This of course included Mojitos and other rum based cocktails.

## Sobre las Olas

For dinner we ventured out, a 3 minute walk to the Italian-Caribbean fresh fish joint that is “[Sobre las Olas](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g309262-d1743130-Reviews-Sobre_las_Olas-Cahuita_Province_of_Limon.html)”. It gets dark early in Costa Rica, and though we were eating at 6 the skies were already black. On the outdoor decking we sat besides the coconut trees, listening to the roaring sea.

Food was delicious, and the portions enormous. We couldn’t finish it all.

* Squid bruschetta
* Tuna fillet with vegetables in a coconut sauce
* A whole red snapper with crispy sweet skin and fries

In the warm humid night air, with our cold Imperial beer, we knew we were now on our long awaited tropical holiday. We meandered back, arm in arm, arriving just in time to avoid the thunderous downpour that carried on all night. (The only rain we had all holiday)

## Poisonous frogs

Dawn is the best time to see wildlife and birds, we set our alarms for 5:30am, though we needn’t have – the noises of nature woke us anyway. The rain conveniently stopped just as the sun came up. We set about exploring the gardens with cameras, not sure what we’d find.

The paths were wet, and perfect for frogs. Beneath my feet hopped a [black-and-green poison dart frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_and_black_poison_dart_frog) (although the green was perhaps a more resplendent turquoise). Bending down low to get a good photo I found myself staring another one in the face; it was chasing its mate, and they soon left the path and did what mating animals do behind a bush. These frogs were everywhere, kamikaze creatures that’d hop out in front of your feet.

Towards the back of the hotel I found my first [Agouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_agouti), a common rodent about the size of a cat, related to Guinea Pigs.

## Gallo Pinto

Costa Ricans, or Ticos, have a diet that consists mostly of rice, beans and bananas. Breakfast is no exception, where the specialty is [Gallo Pinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallo_pinto); it’s beans and rice, cooked with onions and peppers and a bit of coriander, served with fried or scrambled eggs and sometimes soured cream (it’s best with soured cream!). Fruit is served on the side (that’s where banana comes in).

We had some at Le Bergerac, and now again at Atlantida lodge. It’d be a staple breakfast option throughout the holiday, and since holidaying in Asia I’ve loved eating rice for breakfast. The portions here were especially big.

## Sloth sanctuary

10km up the road from Cahuita lies the [Sloth sanctuary](http://www.slothsanctuary.com/), a reserve dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation, release and research of sloths. We’d heard that the sanctuary’s sloths are most active in the mornings, during feeding, after which they mostly sleep; we took a rather pricey $20 taxi (in the most beat-up blinged-up football-fan’s taxi we’d ever seen) to get there for the first 8am tour.

### Canoe tour

We paid for the 2-hour “Buttercup” tour, which begins with a serene canoe ride around the sanctuary’s waterways. On the water’s surface were orange and green petals from the blossoming trees overhead, in the low morning light they glowed magically. In a tree near the water’s edge we found a wild two-toed sloth, and shortly after a caiman resting on the bank. We also passed a group of [Northern Jacana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_jacana) birds. Under a tree trunk we found a sleeping bat.

Costa Rica has a lizard known as the “Jesus Christ Lizard”, or [Common Basilisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_basilisk)/[Plumed Basilisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumed_basilisk), it gets its name for its ability to run across the surface of water; fitting then that our first encounter was to see this brilliant green lizard sprint away from us over the water.

The sounds of a [Montezuma Oropendola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montezuma_oropendola) astounded us; the male mating call sounded like a peculiar laser sci-fi sound effect, its nest is a hanging ball of twigs, and with the way it hops and skips about the trees – as a friend noted, it’s a bird pulled straight out of a cartoon.

### Sanctuary tour

After the boat trip we had our Sloth tuition, we’ve forgotten our guide’s name, but he said “guys” a lot, “guys guys guys” he’d say, trying to steal our group’s attention away from the adorable friendly sloths in the enclosures behind him.

There are two-toed and three-toed sloths in Costa Rica he explained, but really they should be named “two-fingered” and “three-fingered”, as their feet both have three toes. The sloths are very different from each other; two toed is white-haired, has canines, a snout, no tail and can eat fruit; three toed is smaller, lighter, is black and white with facial stripes, and only eats plant leaves – it moves slower too. Most importantly, they found their slow moving, herbivorous lives independently – convergent evolution. Despite the climate and the heat, the sloths are hairy to keep warm, because they move slowly they cannot generate heat, so must efficiently store it.

Many find their way to the sanctuary as rescues; one three-toed sloth named “Toyota”, electrocuted itself when trying to grab onto a power line, he survived for a week before being rescued, his arm needed to be amputated and he’ll live out his life in care; he’s adorable. Others are in car accidents, have been attacked by dogs, or fall from trees.

We learnt about sloth behaviour too; they stay in the treetops, except for once a week when they come down for a toilet break; they dig out a hole and tidily bury their mess in the ground, before climbing back up. Food can take a month to digest, in their four stomachs. In the sanctuary sloths live happily together, in the wild they are solitary; if their partner or friend is taken away in the sanctuary they will become depressed, “imagine a depressed sloth” says our guide. Babies are born “ready to go”, with hair, claws and eyes, after up to a year of gestation; it’s only ever a single baby.

The tour ended with a look at the nursery, where the babies are looked after; they were all sleeping. Many young are brought in, rescued from the pet trade, or babies who have fallen and been abandoned by their mothers; our guide explained that the babies survive the fall, and the mother will come down to pick them up, but that when something is wrong, the baby will keep falling, and eventually the mother must give up. These babies, who haven’t had their one year of sloth tuition will never be able to leave the sanctuary; we cannot impersonate a sloth to teach the baby the behaviours it needs, other sloths don’t care for young that are not theirs, it cannot learn by itself; they’ll live for up to 40 years.

While Samantha perused the gift shop I sat and watched Buttercup move around her hanging seat, looking around, smiling nonchalantly, such a lovely creature. She’s “in season”, and would occasionally let out a high pitched squeal, her mating call.

## Cahuita town

We got the bus back to Cahuita, comfortable, quick and less than a dollar each. From the bus station we had our first opportunity to explore Cahuita itself. It’s rickety, many homes are wooden, on stilts and have holes where you’d normally find windows; it’s one of Costa Rica’s poorer places. It’s not much more than a few criss-crossing streets, a school, a bank, the national park entrance, a beach and a variety of hostels and eateries (or [sodas](http://costarica.com/blog/foodies-guide-to-costa-rican-sodas/) as they’re called here). Reggae music is pumped into the air, and it has a certain Caribbean charm.

## Miss Edith’s

At the far end of town is [Miss Edith’s](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g309262-d1008050-Reviews-Miss_Ediths_s_Restaurant-Cahuita_Province_of_Limon.html), a family run restaurant. They were still setting up when we arrived because they’d just got back from church.

I ordered a rather simple Caribbean fried rice with vegetable; the ever adventurous Samantha ordered the most expensive thing on the menu – lobster; it was both beautiful and delicious – though she left alone the scotch bonnet on the top. The same was true with our drinks; simple mango smoothie for me, Sam had the “Frog Water”, or “Agua de Sapo”, a classic Costa Rican drink comprised of ginger, lime and unrefined sugar cane ([panela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panela)).

## Reggae bar

That afternoon was spent by the pool, and sleeping, we still needed to recover from jet lag. For dinner we headed North along the coast to the “[Reggae bar](http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g309262-d7716739-r263805432-Reggae-Cahuita_Province_of_Limon.html)”, where loud music played, where we drunk Costa Rican Pilsen lager and ate burgers, well I did, Sam had something else – but she wished she’d had the burger, it was massive.

## Tree frogs

A Swedish guest at the hotel, who we met on our Interbus transfer, showed us photos of [red-eyed tree frogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agalychnis_callidryas) she’d seen near the hotel pool. Slightly inebriated we set about finding these beautiful creatures.

The hotel has set up a little pond by the swimming pool, full of plants these frogs love, and with conveniently positioned lights to help you find them (though only for a short time, as the frogs don’t like the light). It didn’t take us long to spot the first one, we found three, but there were surely many more hiding just out of sight – I made the same mistake as in the morning; I tried to get close to one for a photo, and found another _a little too close_.

These tree frogs are bigger than the dart ones, and along the sides of their slender green bodies are blue and yellow stripes. We stared at their bulbous red eyes until we felt sleepy, and trotted off to bed.

Our first day over, we’d already seen coloured frogs, a wild sloth, discovered a crazy bird and seen a Caiman. Today was a good day.
