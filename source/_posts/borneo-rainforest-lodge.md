From the [Shangri-La Rasa Ria in Kota Kinabalu](/2014/05/shangri-la-rasa-ria-borneo/ "Shangri-la Rasa Ria, Borneo") and a stopover at The Crown Hotel near the airport, we headed via Malaysia Airlines to Lahad Datu. A 4:30am wake-up call roused us, though we were half-awake already, the whirr of the pathetic air-con keeping us conscious. On the complimentary airport shuttle we shared stories with a rig worker from Louisiana making his way to Miri, he’d been travelling most of his life and his accent was thick; layered with the histories of places I’ll never know.

Lahad Datu is a small town in the east of Sabah. Our flight (the plane had propellers) touched down at 7:30am at what can be described as a small concrete hut, not unlike a backwater railway station. J from Borneo Adventure Tours was there to meet us, six of us in all; Darren and Emma from Guernsey, Jamie and Ed — medics from the UK, and Samantha and I.

The journey to Borneo Rainforest Lodge isn’t quick. From Lahad Datu it’s a 2h30 drive into the rainforest on a gravel road that disintegrates a little with every fork. On entering the Danum Valley conservation area a sign reads: “Rainforest Lodge 77km”. From thereon the route is lined with nothing but thick jungle foliage, which we rigorously scanned for signs of life. Months old elephant poo was scattered across the road, and the occasional eagle or oriental dart flew overhead. A wild boar, yellow skinned, did run out in front of us, while a mysterious dark eagle sat in a tree watching, but otherwise the journey was uneventful.

“Selamat datang ke Borneo Rainforest Lodge”, a wooden sign welcomed us. Two women in luminous orange shirts placed pandanus wreaths over our heads and ushered us upstairs (shoes off) for a cool lemongrass and ginger welcome drink. The lodge is a beautiful high-ceilinged wooden building; dark wood panels on the walls, and spacious wooden floors dotted with comfy sofas. Fans spin in the rooftops and great lamps hang down into the bar. At the back a veranda opens up to a view of Danum river, lined with tables where we’d dine for breakfast, lunch and dinner (all included). The ground floor is paved, there’s a small shop (where you buy essential bright green leech socks), reception desk and a presentation room. And of course there’s the boot-rack — where all the muddy leech-laden footwear comes to rest after a sweaty trek.

From the lodge we were shown to our room, along a raised wooden walk-way to Deluxe 15, a chalet with a river view and an outdoor bath. There’s no air-conditioning, but you don’t need it. Despite the humidity and heat, the eco-friendly design of the building circulates air efficiently, pulling up cool air from beneath, and venting out hot from the roof — we were always comfortable. There’s little glass, instead air is allowed to circulate through the gaps where you’d expect windows, a tight mesh keeps out the bugs. The room is effectively open to the unrelenting but wonderful smells and sounds of the jungle. At night the chirps of the leafhoppers, squeaks of the geckos, croaks of the frogs and distant howling of gibbons layer to form your midnight lullaby. From our room I watched a deer and her calf carefully cross the river, keeping a watchful eye-out for would-be predators.

Between resting in our room and meeting our guide we moseyed about the lodge, refuelled on the fantastic buffet the lodge puts on everyday, and watched golden red leaf monkeys play amongst the trees above us, a sole monitor lizard scuttled by beneath us.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Playful red lead monkeys](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/borneo-007.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/borneo-007.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Playful red lead monkeys</figcaption></figure>

Our guide was Faezen, broad and sturdy, friendly, he welcomed us, he’d be our guide for the duration. Necessary kit for a hike into the jungle; good boots — check, trousers — check, long-sleeved top, insect repellant, sun lotion, special leech socks (to stop them getting to your toes), a camera with a decent zoom lens, binoculars, wet weather gear (poncho, umbrella), and plenty of water — check. Our first venture would be a short introductory one, a nature trail (a few 100m) followed by the Hornbill trail, about 1km. While we’d rested it had been raining heavily, and the ground was sodden, and protruding tree roots were slippery. The clouds still looked ominous. Don’t come to the rainforest and expect it not to rain.

Despite the introductory nature of this trek it was one of our most eventful. From the offset, in front of us grew an enormous strangling fig tree, a common sight in this virgin rainforest; they begin life as seedlings in the canopy, nested in the knot of another tree, from which they send down their roots. As they grow they entwine and envelop the host tree, often killing it and leaving a peculiar hollow core. Although parasitic, Faezen explained that they fruit more often than the trees they encompass, producing more food for the wildlife. There was a rich smell too, jasmine-like; barritonia flowers scattered the forrest floor, messy, decaying, but that aroma was incredible. Something I hadn’t expected was that much of the jungle would smell spectacular.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![A barritonia flower](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/borneo-iphone-025.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/borneo-iphone-025.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">A [barritonia](http://www.projectnoah.org/spottings/231146016 "Project Noah") flower</figcaption></figure>

Shortly off the wooden nature trail, and round to a river viewing platform we came across another guide with a party of two, necks arced upwards, they all stared into the canopy. “Orangutan” the guide whispered, “two”. We clamoured for a view, but the tree was so tall and they were at the very top, already comfortable in their newly made nest of leaves. Sam caught a glimpse from the base, looking straight up. But Faezen warned, “don’t stand too close, you don’t want the hot shower or the hot chocolate”. With the orangutans inactive for now, we continued.

In the sweaty, humid forest we followed Faezen, stopping briefly here and there for an explanation of one plant or another. Although seemingly calm and still, the jungle is evidently a brutal and competitive place. The plant life resembles a still frame from a war epic; vines strangling trunks, leaves fighting for sunlight, ants pilfering supplies, fungus eating away at crevices, roots zigzagging for the best water source. Yet it is still, motionless, almost silent, a war played out over decades.

As Faezen was pointing to a tree, probably something poisonous or a favourite fruit of orangutan (ebony fruit), I felt an itch on my chest. That’s odd I thought, scratching I felt a short, wet, squiggly thing. Oh no. “I’ve got a leech” I casually said to Sam, the news spread quickly and Faezen intervened — I unbuttoned and bore my chest, and he plucked off the blood-sucking creature with a sharp tug, blood continuing to ooze out into my white shirt. Mild panic ensued as everyone then checked their leech socks; the tiny suckers were climbing up our legs, Ed and I flicked away ten or eleven, (it’s best to flick when they are shaped in a loop, it’s like fighting a slinky) and more kept appearing, the floor was squirming with them. They’re most active after rain, and then, amidst the first great flicking-war the heavens opened. Throughout the trip we were all paranoid a leech was somewhere it shouldn’t be, somewhere up our leg, or on our back, or in darker moister parts we don’t want to think about. I’ve donated blood to the Danum Valley tiger leeches, and I have a certificate to prove it.

A walkie-talkie buzzed and our guide responded, we’re heading back to the orangutan, it’s on the move. They don’t like the rain, and in the downpour they’d decided to up sticks and move. Through our steamed up glasses, speckled with water drops, or struggling to focus through the binoculars, we watched two orangutans swing down and move about the tree-top. Still obscured by foliage, we could see them better now, orange furry apes grasping with all four limbs. The views were fleeting, as, ultimately, the rain made our glasses useless, we couldn’t see anything in the wet. By the end we were just standing outside in the storm, getting drenched. Frustrated but exhilarated, we returned to our chalets desperate for a shower and a decent leech check.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Can you see the orang-utan?](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/borneo-008.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/borneo-008.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Can you see the orang-utan?</figcaption></figure>

After sunset we returned for our next adventure, a night drive in an open topped truck with an enormous movable lamp for finding wildlife in the trees. Thankfully it had stopped raining, but going out right after rain makes spotting hard. Wildlife doesn’t come out so much in the wet, and where you’d usually use movement in the trees or leaves to find things, instead the leaves move with dripping water — anything that is there is effectively camouflaged. Nevertheless, we boarded the truck and continued. It’s hard to imagine you’d see much anyway, the great roar of the truck must scare off whatever is lying in wait.

Our first spotting was a family of sambar deer, unfazed by the truck withs its lights and noise. The light flitted from tree to tree, scanning up and down the trunks. “A flying squirrel”, and the light pointed into a tree. I couldn’t see anything, no movement or reflecting eyes, “it’s in the middle of the light”, “ah yes I see it” others said, I remained in the dark. That was the story for the other squirrel sightings too. The only other sighting was a couple of five-horned frogs perched up on a branch. Still, being out in the jungle at night was uplifting. At the end of the road the truck stopped and we turned off the lights, in the darkness we listened to the roaring noise of the nighttime jungle, the only light coming from the occasional firefly, pulsing green as it flew by.

Back at the lodge we ate another spectacular buffet. A few bugs zipped about the place, but by our feet was a docile rhinoceros beetle, about the size of my hand. Despite its size we got very close for pictures, it was quite harmless (unless you didn’t see him and stood on him with your bare feet). He hung about for the rest of our trip, always somewhere about the place. I’ve got this far into the day and failed to mention that it was our fourth wedding anniversary! So much happened that we too forgot for the most part. We celebrated with some wine and retired for the night, tomorrow’s trek would begin at 6:30am.

Borneo rainforest lodge has a spectacular canopy walk, 300m in length, 26m high at its tallest point. The swinging bridges are tied to great menogaris trees. Their trunks feel like concrete. At 6:30am, to the songs of gibbons, we headed there. Shortly after sunrise the forest is eery and misty and clouds dangle in the treetops, waiting for the sun to set them free. The red and green bridges swung as we walked across, resonating with our footsteps, unsteady but secure. The handrails feel precariously low in the middle, and Samantha braved her vertigo, going last and stepping slowly. We crossed to the end and back again. Our only spotting was a small blue bird, possibly a rufous winged philentoma. On the road back we passed some birders, a telescope was setup in the road, and we narrowly missed seeing the rare Bornean bristlehead through a scope, instead it flew overhead and out of sight. Though we did see two large bushy-crested hornbills, some land crabs and a large black-feathered bird with red under its wing, but I haven’t a clue what it was.

The 8am breakfast felt like lunch, especially when you’re eating fried rice and noodles (a habit I’d like to continue in London if anywhere sold that sort of thing so early). By 10 we were off out again on the longest of our treks, the ominous sounding Coffincliff trail, still only 3km but mostly up. “My friends are waiting for us”, Faezen said, pointing at the leeches dangling from the trail signpost. “They detect your heat”, he demonstrated by waving his hand underneath, the thin tip of the leech swaying to and fro as his palm went by. Ahead of us a group of pig-tailed macaques crossed, “That’s Judas and his family”, Faezen warned us to keep our distance, “they’re dangerous and may attack, don’t stare at them”. Wildlife spottings were otherwise sparse, mostly millipedes and strange fungi, with the occasional pygmy or black squirrel. We did pick up on the scent of monkey piss at one point, “either someone has a really bad UTI or there’s a monkey about”, Ed, a medic, noted. Half-way we came to the coffincliff, a vertical wall where tribes buried their dead in ironwood coffins, human bones still littered the area — dislodged from their resting place by monkeys, sunbears and the like.

Beyond the cliff we climbed to a viewpoint which overlooked the lodge and hill after hill of million year old virgin rainforest. When it’s gone, it’s gone I thought in a brief but sombre moment, how much longer will it last? We continued on to the fairy waterfall, another 10 minutes down a steep hill, and then all the way back to a jacuzzi pool. By jacuzzi pool they meant a natural pond with waterfall and hungry fish (and no leeches, at least not in the water). “In the Amazon the piranha take flesh and bone, here they just nibble”, that’s how it was sold to us, they weren’t Piranhas (they were Perulean fish), but they did give a good pedicure, nibbling at the dead skin on our feet (and elsewhere if you got in deeper and didn’t move).

As per usual in the rainforest the sweltering hot sun gave way to dark clouds and rumbles of thunder. And just as everyone came out of the pool, to dry off, the heavens opened once more. We all crammed under what little cover there was in the wooden changing rooms, protecting our bags whilst changing out of swimwear. In the dripping wet we clambered back to the lodge, thankful to have both wet weather gear and an umbrella.

Between activities, and as the rain fell, I reclined out on our chalet’s veranda watching the river and the few birds that flitted about between the raindrops. A little spider-eater fed from wild ginger and banana flowers, and a small lizard scuttled up a tree. Despite the storm it was peaceful, the sound of rain patting leaves was calming.

In the afternoon the group split between two activities; Sam, Jamie and Darren went tubing down the river while Ed, Faezen and I did another short walk through the forest. The tubing was apparently great fun, in swimwear and flip-flops they left with huge inflated rubber rings. The river took them downstream where they saw red leaf monkeys and Sam had a special encounter with two playful yet enormous moths; possibly an atlas moth and a moon moth. But beauty is fleeting and in the river she didn’t have a camera. Still, the guides with her were jealous. At the shallow points they hoisted the tube to their waste and walked downstream, the river not really deep enough at low tide. Ed and I followed the Hornbill trail again, from the river view point we saw the same red leaf monkeys. We walked for about an hour with our guide, periodically checking socks and boots for intrepid leeches. In a leafless dead tree the black ruffled feathers of a crested eagle were unmissable. Down by the river, where we expected to meet the others, the pig-tailed macaques were back. Judas watched as a group of 12 or so ate, groomed and played on the riverbank before climbing away in the trees.

The rain continued until nightfall, and we waited it out in our river-view outdoor bath. It stopped just as our night time trek began. Armed with torches, some good, some pathetic, we ventured into the night in search of the nocturnal. We furiously shone light up and down tree trunks, into dark crevices, into the foliage; hoping to catch a glimpse of something, maybe two bright eyes reflecting back at us. But like before, dripping water and moving leaves thwarted us. At the frog-pond we located the croak sounds of a five-horned frog and stumbled on a scary palm sized huntsman spider above our heads. Near the staff quarters we found a brown wood owl and a family of grazing sambar deer. Faezen pointed to a tree with his torch, “look here, in the hole”, a female tarantula with babies. They all sat perfectly still, waiting for their meal to wander by.

Sam and I were staying for three nights, but the rest of our group were leaving a day sooner, this was their last night. Beneath large wicker lamps at the lodge we drank cheap cocktails and wine together. Amidst the noises of rhino-beetles crashing into things (they really are awful fliers), we reminisced about kids TV shows, and shared our onward plans. Heading back to our chalets later than we ought to, we had a close encounter with two large deer, grazing beneath the wooden gangway in the dark — they were a little too close, and we and the deer both nervously backed away.

With our muddy and damp walking boots on the porch, green leech socks spread over them to dry, we nestled in for the night to the sounds of the jungle.

<!--nextpage-->

Our first trek wasn’t until 8:30am, but Sam awoke before dawn and went out for a quiet walk on her own. She was on the lookout for gibbons, but this morning they were shy, not even singing their howling chorus. Nevertheless, Sam enjoyed her meander about the riverside, lodge and nature trail. A mouse-deer ran by, too fast for her to snap a good photo, and many birds (and birders) were about, searching for their morning meals.

Six of us plus Faezen set out one last time together for a short morning trek along the Hornbill trail. For the most part the walk was uneventful, there weren’t too many leeches, conditions were nice and the trail was easy. The highlight was a spot of millipede golf, tapping the small creatures so they roll into a protective ball and then rolling them away, gently of course. Faezen and I led the way on the final stretch, we’d almost reached the end of the trail, when Ed spotted something in the foliage, “Orangutan” he shouted. We all rushed to see two hairy ginger apes swing high into the trees above. Using his walkie-talkie our guide radio’d in the find.

With the orangutans heading out of sight, Faezen, and now another guide too, led us off-trail into the dense jungle itself, heading after them. We quietly, and ever-so carefully, trampled through the trees and vines towards the tree they’d stopped in. Finding angles to view the treetop was difficult, we squatted on the floor, or leaned precariously, and moved our heads about to and fro, looking for line of sight to the wonderful wild apes. And there they were, sitting quietly in the treetop, eating, relaxing, grooming, two of them. I lined up the camera, full zoom at 200mm, hand-held, manual focus, and delicately began snapping, but that elusive profile shot of an orangutan looking right at us evaded me. Either leaves covered my view, or they looked away, nonetheless it was magical just to have the opportunity. We were motionless and transfixed for almost 20 minutes, whatever creepy crawlies were clambering on us from the close proximity leaves, they were irrelevant. In that moment we watched the orangutans, and nothing else mattered. It was incredible.

When we did decide to leave, our guide pointed out, “This is leech paradise, watch out for the baby ones”. And, as expected, we all had leeches somewhere on us. The babies were so tiny, it’s hard to imagine how’d you’d ever stop them from getting through the gaps in your clothes. Miraculously Sam and I were bite free. Sam stayed the longest, and from the trail, even though I knew she was there and not far away, and wearing bright clothes, I couldn’t see her. The plants obscured all view of her. When she did materialise, I’ll always remember that smile, an ear-to-ear grin. Yes, those last 20 minutes were a little bit special.

On the lodge veranda we all shared one last meal together, swapping emails and dropbox accounts for photo sharing, and then we said our farewells. We were staying on for another day of treks, and our next activity was at 4:30pm, a dusk walk. Between now and then we filled our time with some short trails we could do ourselves, heading over to the river view platform, around the little nature trail, around the lodge itself. I enjoyed patiently watching whatever it was I found, without the need to continue on a trail, whether it was a spotted fantail, a yellow rumped flower pecker or a family of long-tailed macaques. It was very hot, and it was the only day without any rain.

In the late afternoon we began the long Segama trail which crosses the river and continues alongside its bank before crossing back and joining the Ginger trail, which in turn ends at the canopy walkway. About 4hrs of hiking in total. The smells of barritonia filled the air again; a fragrant jungle. Either brave or foolish, I set out in a t-shirt this time — without signs of rain, and with a lower humidity this was probably the most pleasant of conditions (ultimately my arms were bitten by a peculiar jungle bug that left an itching mark which frustrated me all the way home). Scattered on the floor were “fake coconut seeds”, a large kernel with two silky white wings, they float down from trees like butterflies. I saved one and threw it from the canopy bridge to watch it fly.

We came across red leaf monkeys again, more millipedes (though no giants), great strangling fig trees and odd fungi. We heard the calls of hornbills. With clear skies above us and the sun setting there was a lovely blue light filling the forest, which gave way to the colours of dusk. The cicadas stopped, and on time, as if scheduled, the calls of leafhoppers begun, like an alarm siren they droned incessantly. A wake-up call for the nocturnal. Near our path was another new noise, a beeping, not unlike the regular chirps of sonar; it was a little litter frog hiding in a branch.

By sundown we were at the canopy walk. Faezen pointed out two flying squirrel nests, one in the tree above us and one across the bridge. “They come out about now, and fly only once”. Patiently we stood on the swaying rope bridge, angled to see whichever squirrel decided to come out first. Finally, as the light was fading, a small dark silhouette emerged and scarpered about the branches. Then, without warning, as if making a sudden decision, it launched itself from the tree, arms and legs out, ‘wings’ open, it glided effortlessly to the forest floor far below. And I got most of it on camera.

It then became a night trail, and as we followed the road back to the lodge we used our torches to search for creatures. In a tree we spotted another tarantula, and a timid mouse deer hid amongst the bushes. But despite tonight’s perfect conditions we were relatively unlucky, the tarsiers and loris remained out of sight. It was World Earth Day, so between 8pm and 9pm all the lights were out at the lodge. It meant we were eating our last dinner here by candlelight. Ordinarily that’s romantic, but light attracts bugs, lots and lots of them, so too does food. It was awkward at best. We finished up quickly and called it a night.

I don’t know how she did it, but Sam convinced me to get up before 6am on our final day. Our last chance to see gibbons, and we could hear their calls this morning. Up and out in the early light, the world was misty and still, cool after the overnight thunderstorm. Our final trek wasn’t until 8:30am. At the lodge a group were gathered watching something by the river, alas they were birders and the birds were gone. A guide confirmed the songs we could hear were those of gibbons, but that they were miles away and we wouldn’t see them.

Alone we walked the nature trail and then the canopy walk. We were the first to cross the bridge where beautiful dew-drop spider webs spanned our path, we left them intact where we could. Rather crazily I balanced the camera on a slim wooden ledge, focused, set a timer and ran to join Samantha for some photos of the both of us, something we usually forget to do.

After breakfast we met Faezen again. He showed us a butler moth that had died in his room. This morning’s trail, our last, was the Selamba trail, followed by a part of the Hornbill trail. For the last time we set-off from the lodge, headed past the staff quarters and along the riverbank. Two new villas were being built, ready for April and an opening ceremony, the Malaysian Prime Minister was coming too. On the trail Faezen explained how tribes made blow pipes from ironwood (a branch is placed upright in a waterfall, which erodes away the fleshy inner part to create a tube, it only takes 6 months). On the floor were “fake durian”, black rotten husks that don’t contain any fruit (and didn’t smell).

Emerging from the Selamba trail, Faezen spoke on his walkie-talkie and marched us quickly down the road to the Hornbill trail. His friend, another guide, had found something we should see. In-sight of that guide, who stood looking through his camera on a tripod, we walked slowly and silently to him, my eyes were drawn to movement in the trees, but that’s not what he was looking at, that was red leafed monkeys swinging away. Instead, magically, he was transfixed on an enormous bird stood in the middle of the trail. It had a blue head with a silver mohican, a golden brown chest and enormous spotted feathers reaching out behind — like those of a peacock. It was the elusive and rare Great Argus, a bird I’d read about but never dreamed of seeing. In the clearing the Argus was tidying away the dead leaves, preparing a space to dance in, to impress and woo a female. The mating call is beautifully simple, a two-toned caw, unmistakeable. For a wonderful 45 minutes we stood and watched the bird, waiting and hoping that it might dance. A few times it looked like he was about to start, he ruffled his feathers and hopped, but then resumed tidying. He had an audience, just not the one he wanted, and despite his caws no female ever came. This was without doubt one of the most amazing things either of us had ever seen, unforgettable.

Eventually we had to leave, but on the way out we had another surprise. On the forest floor a tiny blue and red bird moved about, this too was a rare bird, endemic to Borneo it was a blue-headed pita. And once again we were lucky to see it, and then it was gone, our last wildlife spotting at the Borneo Rainforest Lodge. What a way to end the trip.

The Borneo Rainforest Lodge is a very special, secluded though exclusive place in the heart of virgin rainforest. I do desperately wish to return, seeing wildlife, however long you have to wait, or however fleeting, is magical. By 1pm we’d packed up our room, had lunch and were climbing into a minibus for the 2h30 drive back to Lahad Datu. Two flights later and by 2am we were back in the concrete jungle that is Kuala Lumpur, otherworldly.

Our return to Kuala Lumpur was brief, a one night stay at the funky and swanky Aloft Hotel. We split up the flights and road travel from Borneo with our international flights to give us a chance to recover. Of course, we chose somewhere with a gorgeous rooftop infinity pool and for our six waking hours in KL we spent most of it by the pool drinking caipirinhas and mojitos. At the hotel’s Nook restaurant we had our last taste of Malaysia; it was suitably decked out in lime green to fit in with our holiday theme.

Getting to the airport from Aloft is effortless, at KL Sentral there’s an express train direct to the terminal. Ingeniously it has a desk for you to check-in your bags and get your boarding tickets, right from the train station. Our heavy rucksacks were whisked away out of sight, presumably packed onto the train, and delivered straight to our flight. Amazing.

From KL we flew to Dubai in an Airbus A380 — the double-decker plane. Then on to Gatwick and Brighton. 24 hours later we were in bed, sleeping off our jet lag, our incredible Borneo adventure was over. From the dizzying heights of the Petronas Towers, to the humid Sarawakan rainforests, to the decadent luxury of a Shangri-la, and finally to Danum valley’s incredible jungle wilderness; Malaysia, Borneo — you are sublime.
