Florida wasn’t somewhere on our must visit list, in fact it didn’t feature at all. But when Samantha’s sister invited us to her beach wedding on Anna Maria island, near Tampa and Bradenton, we thought we’d make a holiday of it. Especially after the effort of a long haul flight with an 18 month old baby.

Whenever we mentioned our family holiday to Florida, it was assumed we were going to Disney World – “it’s not really our thing” we replied. For our first week we’d focus on the wedding, staying with close family in an Airbnb on Longboat key. For our second week we drove up to Georgia and Jekyll Island. Between these we’d visit Cape Canaveral, and on our last day, yes, for one day, because we were flying home from Orlando, we paid a visit to Disney’s Magic Kingdom.

## Brighton to Longboat key

We flew with Sam’s mum, on a 7 hour Virgin Atlantic flight to Orlando. Having 3 adults to 1 baby made the flight easier, and in seats offering a bassinet and extra legroom, we played and entertained each other, the time passed by, and we didn’t need our TV screens or movies.

We rented a car big enough for 3 adults, baby, luggage and buggy (or stroller as we’ve come to know it). That meant a mid-sized SUV, still a small vehicle on America’s roads. We rented through Alamo, and after landing (and a brief foray at customs where we decided to declare some clementines rather than leave them on the plane – don’t do this, it’s not worth it), we picked our car – “pick any one you want, the keys are on the dashboard”.

In our white Hyundai Tucson automatic we pulled out of the parking lot and into Florida’s bright sunshine, aircon blasting, Apple maps giving directions – our destination 3 hours away. After a brief mixup, a wrong turn and a U-turn, we were travelling West along FL-417 then the interstate I-4. Wide lanes, and plenty of space made driving easy, though Orlando’s evening rush slowed us down. We drove past the turning for Disney World, a Mickey Mouse eared pylon indicating Disney’s territory.

Spotify played a calming yoga playlist, and Conway slept in his new oversized car seat. We kept going all the way to Fruitville, Sarasota, the bridge to St. Armand’s then north to our condo. Harry’s convenience store gave us all the immediate reserves we needed.

## Longboat key condo

The pictures of our Airbnb condo made it look diminutive. It was not, and it welcomed us with high ceilings, light rooms and comfortable furnishings. It looked East, out onto Sarasota bay, visible through classic Venetian blinds and palms and yacht masts. An outdoor balcony sat above a lush blue swimming pool.

In the bay we watched brown pelicans, fishing bald eagles and once in a while a dolphin or two would surface close by.

At dawn the morning sun turned everything a glorious rich orange.

---

We’d given ourselves enough time before the wedding activities to acclimatise and relax. On our first day it was all about overcoming jet lag, getting Conway onto the right timezone, eating and trying to relax. We were up early, and had porridge (oatmeal) and coffee for breakfast.

Sam, Conway and Sam’s mum (Nana) enjoyed a swim in the pool, a bald eagle overlooked them from a nearby tree. I tidied, and then while Conway napped – for 3 hours – Sam and Nana drove to Publix to buy lunch.

The bride and groom to be joined us for lunch, and we ate delicious fresh pastrami with pickles, cheese, chips and ginger ale.

## The loft at Euphemia Haye

Around 5:30 we grew hungry, and realised that despite the morning’s trip to buy food, we didn’t actually have anything for dinner. This would be the only night we could have dinner with Nana, we quickly got our things together and headed out to find a restaurant.

Euphemia Haye was nearby, and its one of the best restaurants in the area, offering a fine dining experience – they didn’t have a table, but – they did have space upstairs in The Loft – a separate and more casual affair, with some of the same fantastic food. Nana and I ordered expensive duck, Sam had a prawn Cesar salad and Conway – as usual – got the best pickings from all of us – and a free banana he’d spied on the dessert counter.

We rounded out the meal with two giant slices of key lime pie to go.

---

Conway was soon au fait with our condo, he was just tall enough to open some of the doors, he ventured into the kitchen and explored all the cupboards, he kicked and threw his beach ball off the walls, and danced when we put music on. This morning he ate porridge in a new pink polo shirt, outside a flock of pelicans flew by.

## The beach at Longboat key

This morning, before it got too hot, I took some time out to find a route to the beach. As the crow flies it’s super close, but the road is lined with private mansions and private beach access, and there’s no obvious way through.

A 10 minute walk north and there’s public beach access, to a pristine beach with soft glowing sand, calm blue water, washed up shells and seabirds. Ruddy turnstones, willets, sandpipers, sanderlings and laughing gulls peruse the wet sands. Later in the year you’d find turtle tracks too.

We ate our take-home key lime pie on the balcony, the sugary sweetness of 2 slices still too much when divided by three. Nana left with the to-be weds and best man, firstly to help buy all the wedding booze, then going on to stay with the parents of the groom. They were running errands all day – up and down the county buying things, finding things, getting suits, picking up guests from the airport and more.

## The distances between things

In Brighton we walk everywhere – from our flat we stroll into town, go to the beach, do our shopping or go to appointments. Everything is accessible on foot. Longboat key, and by extension Florida and the USA are the opposite, places are designed for big cars – roads are wide, parking lots big and plentiful, and everything spread out. This took some getting used to.

We needed to hop in the car for everything, and then, particularly from Longboat key, everything is at least a 10 minute drive. It’s 10 minutes to the nearest shop, but 40 minutes to most places in Sarasota or Bradenton, where the wedding chores were. If you’re in a car, the massive parking lot means parking is always easy – the ‘where will I park’ anxiety that comes with driving in England isn’t a thing here. There’s always a space. It’s just, to get from a shop to the one next door, you need to drive too.

While Samantha and Conway napped, I took a trip to Publix and we cooked a chilli con carne.

## Baby’s first waves

We live by the sea, but since Conway has been walking we haven’t been down to the waterfront – it’s been winter and the water is shockingly cold. When the afternoon had cooled, and we wouldn’t instantly melt into a pool of sweat, we took the stroller out to the beach.

We covered ourselves in SPF50 sun lotion, donned summer hats, and stepped through the sands down to the sea. We let Conway meander to the water’s edge in his blue beach shoes, and when the waves washed in and covered his feet he giggled with glee. With each wave there was excited laughter, mummy lifted him and they played at dodging the waves, or just embraced the cool sea water, wide smiles on our faces.

## Fondue

I stayed at home to babysit while Sam joined the wedding party and family for an evening meal of fondue in Sarasota. Grandad (and father of the bride), landed in Tampa, and he would be staying with us for 4 days.

---

The staple Florida sunshine was replaced with wind and rain this morning. Best to get all this bad weather out of the way before the beach wedding. It was almost a little bit cold.

With everyone now in the US, some of us gathered again for breakfast. Bridesmaids, bride and groom, other halves and granddad all gathered around a high table at Gulf Drive Cafe for a proper American breakfast.

There were pancakes, cheese grits, eggs over easy, maple syrup, tacos, toast and jelly. Grandad was bamboozled by the egg options – he asked for fried, and when our server listed the types his face became one of bewilderment like she was speaking another language, to our amusement. I also tried to eat some pancakes without maple syrup, which is a crime. Conway snacked on little bits from all of us, but mostly stacked all the plastic jelly and jam pots before knocking them down and starting again.

## Hen do

Activities were planned for last night, but jet lag, a day of driving, and dinner finishing later, meant all the girls were falling asleep rather than partying. They postponed until today – and after breakfast they all went down the beach to The Beach House restaurant, for celebratory drinks and some quality time. Leaving us lads to drink and play cornhole on the beach, getting slowly coated in salt from the sea spray. Conway tried his hand at the game, picking up the beanbags and throwing them, but soon resorting to climbing the ramps and putting the bags directly in the hole – usually as someone was trying to take their turn.

## Wedding rehearsal

After a brief shopping trip to Publix – and a delicious Pub sub, we recouped and regrouped at the house where most of the wedding party were staying – a grand building above a double garage and besides a canal, it was a friend of a friend’s place.

We all ate takeaway pizza and had drinks in the garden, by the water’s edge – where we could watch random fish leap above the water. Conway ran around, unwilling to be held, he needed a full time adult to protect him from the canal, the swimming pool, the stairs and garden ornaments. He ate pizza and his cheesy greasy fingers threatened many dresses with ruin. By the pool, groomsmen and bridesmaids practiced the ceremony, led by the groom’s mom.

I brought Conway home early, the evening already late – in the night sky I found the first star and showed him, “Star” he said, I told him the stars will always be there, for his whole life. “Buy-bye” he said to the star, as we got in the car to drive home.

## Wedding day

The wedding would begin at 4pm, on Coquina beach. In the morning I drove into Bradenton to pick up the bouquet, and some “baby’s breath” – a wispy white flower – the florist showed me, hardy and pretty stuff you can put everywhere. I picked up maid of honour Samantha and she and the flowers went to the house to prepare – makeup, dress, hair, and so on.

For Grandad, Conway and me it was a quiet day, as everyone was getting ready elsewhere we played with wooden cars and beach balls, sat on the balcony with coffee and ate lunch. Three dolphins lifted up above the water right in front of us to our amazement. The bay was busy with weekend boats, and we watched groups prep and set sail from the little marina by our pool.

At 2pm we began to get ready, Conway in his little grey suit, me in my big grey suit, Grandad in his – white shirt rather than pink – he thought he hadn’t packed it. Frustratingly we hadn’t managed to get Conway to nap – now nearing the wedding he would be growing sleepy.

I dropped Grandad – father of the bride – at the house, and with another wedding guest we drove up to the beach, traffic was busy for the weekend and the car park boiling over. Conway fell asleep in the car, and in the hot afternoon I carried him beneath the pines to the gathering of guests – we would all wait in the shade until the last moment, a little electric fan kept baby cool. When the limo carrying bride and all was spotted we all dashed out to our seats on the open beach.

In the hot sunshine Conway stirred, he woke up and began to cry. It was so hot, and he wanted his mummy. Nana and I did our best to comfort him and give him shade, but he was having none of it. Here comes the bride, in her beautiful white dress, Grandad on her arm, groom waiting by the arch. Everyone on the beach stopped to watch, they filmed it on their phones, they cheered. Oh, poor baby, crying at the wrong moment. Mummy followed in her sleek blue dress, bridesmaids behind, and Conway couldn’t go to her yet, and the crying kicked up a notch. I took him away, back to the shade, and back beneath the pines he quietened.

The wedding continued, behind the sand dune. We heard cheers, and with baby in arms we watched husband and wife head back down the aisle, clapping and cheering all around for the happy couple. And as they had their photos taken, sunglasses on, Conway got to breastfeed beneath a parasol.

We drove in to Bradenton for the reception, our car’s aircon cooling us all down, we had to stop at the bridge, it was open to let all the weekend boats through. We arrived before the limo, and watched newlyweds, groomsmen, bridesmaids and mother of the bride get out in style. There’d been whisky in there too.

Everyone applauded and cheered, as one by one bridesmaids and the happy couple were introduced and took their seats for food. We ate Cracker Barrel fried chicken, macaroni cheese, beef, ’slaw and salad. There were speeches and bridesmaids tag-teamed hilariously. They danced their first dance and wedding photos were taken outside – in the calm evening light, palms silhouetted against a Florida sunset. They cut the cake and attacked each other with icing, the bottom tier was chocolate and peanut butter and it was oh so good.

Music played, and Conway ran about, excited by everything and all the attention, he danced, he played with other children, he hugged the bride and played in her dress, he tried to get behind the bar, or work out the water cooler, he loved Nana’s dress, and he held on tight to the bride as she threw her bouquet. He jiggled his little feet, and rocked his shoulders, swayed his head, all with a wide-eyed grin, he had the best night, and he carried on, all the way through until the end, when he fell asleep as his head lay in the car seat, looking adorable in his waistcoat.

When our heads hit the pillows they had the same effect.

## Sunday brunch

Following the wedding, and now that everything was done, on the calm morning after, we had one last group event – a quiet Sunday brunch. It was originally going to be at the house, but we rearranged to have it in our condo, which had plenty of space for everyone, and would be a little more chilled.

Bride and groom, bridesmaids, grandparents, mother of the groom, best man, an aunt and uncle – they all arrived in cars and joined us to eat the most fantastic American breakfast; freshly made pancakes with bacon and maple syrup, croissants, coffee, leftover macaroni cheese and fried chicken, biscuits and scones, and scrambled eggs.

## The quiet

Everyone left all at once, and in the early afternoon our condo was quiet again, the music playlist nonchalantly ended itself. There was enough food left over to feed us for days. Soon everyone would be departing Longboat key – going back home, near or far, or on a honeymoon or extended holiday.

Conway found an old box, he climbed in and we whizzed around on the carpet like a race car, “more, more” he said, as dad and grandad panted, taking turns to rest.

As the afternoon cooled, and when there was shade, we stood around in the swimming pool, Conway resumed his bath time activities of pouring water from one cup to another – an activity that occupies him endlessly. We played ball too, and took turns actually swimming. Egrets, herons and pelicans flew by, and weekend boaters returned to port.

It was our last evening with Grandad tonight, or “dad dad”, as Conway has begun calling him. I put on an evening jazz playlist, and once Conway was asleep we played a game of Carcassonne together – Samantha had managed to smuggle the pieces into our luggage without me knowing so I wouldn’t complain. With IPA beer and Sangria we sat at the large glass table and fought with meeples to win the most points.

---

## Myakka state park

Grandad’s flight wasn’t until late afternoon, if we were organised we could get up and out and have a day trip somewhere beforehand. Myakka state park was an hour away – that’s nearby in US terms – down to Sarasota and out East. We cooked up some pizzas and took them for lunch. Grandad – let’s go find some ’gators.

Myakka is one of the state’s biggest and oldest parks, but the majority of the visitor activities are concentrated along a scenic road in the north west. We bought our tickets and drove through, passing beneath the beautiful overhanging tree limbs, draped in southern Spanish moss, and stopping at the first bridge on advisement.

In the baking hot sunshine, lathered in sun lotion and sun hats on, we peered out over the edge of the concrete crossing, and down below us were the much anticipated wild alligators, three on the left bank, and one in the shade of a tree very close to us.

A little further on is the car park for a short nature trail and canopy walk. We faffed with the buggy and all the baby things, not quite sure how long it’d be, it’s not long, then we set out into the forest. Conway wore his explorer outfit, a pair of fake binoculars printed on his chest. The canopy walk sits 25 feet above the ground and is 100 feet along, apparently the first in North America – it was a little diminutive, but Conway enjoyed climbing its steps and peering out through the wooden slats. Sam was less au fait with the heights.

Grandad goes sailing most weekends, the prospect of a boat trip wasn’t exciting to him. We thought a boat would bring us closer to water birds and gators, it’d be exciting we argued. So when we arrived at the ticket office and saw one was just leaving, we didn’t really think and immediately boarded that tourist boat, one which goes out to the lake to spot things. But this was the dullest boat ride we’ve ever been on – in low tide the boat ran aground on entering the lake, 10 minutes later we were free, and chugging along at its ever so slow top speed across the water to where there might be some alligators. There were, in the distance, just about. The boat turned around and we headed back, very slowly.

It wasn’t all bad - it lulled Conway to sleep, he slept right through the whole thing. Our boat guide was a little dry, but he did tell us all about alligators – how and when they nest, how eggs near the top are males – those at the bottom female – the males get eaten by predators first, how many survive to adulthood, how big they get, and some bad jokes too. One wildlife sighting made it worth it – an Osprey flew overhead, looking for fish, a first for me to see one in the wild – a rare sight in the UK.

After our exhilarating boat journey we ate pizza and carried on along the scenic drive, to the north side of the lake where there’s a bird hide. Though not so much a hide, but a shelter from the sun that overlooked the distant water. Later in the year the lake would cover everything, but right now the water level was too low to see much.

With the clock nearing 2pm, we needed to head out and back north, to Tampa, to drop Grandad at the airport for his flight. Our drive out saw us pass a wild deer, and we stopped again at the bridge – where there were more gators, a crane, a stork, and amazingly for us – a bird top of our to see list – two roseate spoonbills.

## Continuing alone to the Space Coast

With Grandad flying home to the UK, and nana leaving tomorrow (but we wouldn’t see her), the rest our our vacation would be just us. That quietness struck us on the drive home, no more extra adults to help with everything – Conway slept in the back of the Hyundai for the 2 hour drive back to Longboat key. We talked about what a fantastic time we’d had here on Florida’s west coast.

Our Airbnb rental was ending tomorrow, soon we’d be headed North to Jekyll island in Georgia, but first we had to plan the stop-over tomorrow night. Conveniently there was a SpaceX rocket launch planned from Cape Canaveral – a Falcon 9 takeoff, less conveniently it would be at 2am, two days from now.

For months I’d been following all the scheduled launches – I’d dearly hoped to see the Falcon Heavy take off on its first commercial mission, but that successfully rocketed into space a week before we arrived. This second launch was our best bet, and I’d originally bought tickets for a viewing on our first Thursday – this got delayed until Friday and moved to the early morning – all tickets got refunded. And now it’d been delayed again, until this Wednesday morning, the perfect morning for us to be there and see it. Any later and we’d be too far North in Georgia to get there.

With 1 day to go everything was still scheduled, the launch looked good, and we booked an overnight hotel in Cape Canaveral. We’d drive there first thing tomorrow. Wherein first thing turns out to be 11am after we’d spent all morning packing everything.

---

Goodbye longboat key, goodbye Bradenton. Onwards we drove, away from Tampa, along the I-4, east, past Orlando and through to the space coast. Cruise control on, feet resting, buttons on the steering wheel for changing speed, we rode in the same lane for hours at a time. Ads for personal injury lawyers flew by, sharing space with hotlines for God.

## Kennedy Space Center

We headed straight for the Kennedy Space Center, down the NASA causeway, over the Indian river. Seeing the giant vehicle assembly building on the horizon sent shivers down my spine. There’s so much history here, so much accomplishment, it’s like in all the movies. Scenes from Contact sprung to mind as black pelicans flew over. And just as the anticipation was building – a sign – flashing – it told us the upcoming launch was delayed a day. Just hours ago it was still on. We’d miss the SpaceX launch, the ISS wasn’t ready and NASA had asked for the resupply mission to be postponed. Slightly deflated, but still excited to see all the space things – we continued to KSC, parked, bought our multi-day ticket and rushed into the complex.

It was 2pm, giving us just enough time to take the bus tour and see the Apollo Saturn V center. We ran around to the buses and boarded the first one – a midweek afternoon, it wasn’t busy. Obviously a bus trip is the best idea after a 3 hour car drive, but we didn’t mind.

The bus took us out of the visitor center, through the security checkpoint and onto NASA land – first stop, the giant vehicle assembly building (VAB), up close and enormous.

A giant American flag emblazoned the front. Out back, its enormous doors slightly ajar, we could see workmen and the building’s incredible scale. Here too are the mobile launch platform and crawler transporter – previously used for the space shuttle missions, they were now being adapted for NASA’s new Space Launch System (SLS), the most powerful rocket ever built, with the first test missions currently scheduled for June 2020.

From the VAB the tour took us out to the launch pads – our tour operator expected to see the Falcon 9 scheduled for launch – she hadn’t received the update. The pad was sadly empty.

We passed other historical launch pads as we headed out to the most important one – Launch Complex 39 and launch pads 39A and 39B. This is where we left Earth for the moon. It’s where the space shuttle took off. Alligators and tortoises wander the water pools and roads.

Pad 39A has been adapted for SpaceX and their Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. While pad 39B is being adapted for the SLS missions. Large pylons give protection from lightning strikes, and gone are the iconic vertical supports used for the shuttle and Apollo programs – replaced with horizontal integration systems – rockets arrive lying down and are raised into position on site.

### Apollo center

The tour ends at the Apollo center – a museum dedicated to the moon landings and the missions that led to them. From the bus we decamped into a large theatre – where we’re shown Kennedy’s inspiring speech, and the history of the Gemini missions, and the sacrifices made – in particular those during Apollo’s first launch rehearsal, when a fire broke out in the command module killing the crew.

> We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard

The theater opens up and we continue, out into a mock-up control room for a simulated launch of Apollo 8. Conway slept in Samantha’s arms throughout the build up and countdown.

And then we leave the simulation, and find ourselves standing before the awesome thrusters of a giant Saturn V “moon” rocket. The entire rocket lies before us, stretching out as far as we can see. Woah.

We walked up and down beneath the rocket, truly taking in its scale, then explored the  exhibits – touching a bit of moon returned to earth, seeing mockups of a lunar rover, a historic command module, iterations of space suits and space gloves, space tools and video cameras – all the most advanced technologies the 60s had to offer.

Conway ran around in delight, revelling in the wide open space and shiny floors beneath the rocket. One of us kept an eye on him while the other attempted to read all the descriptions.

We took the bus back to the main visitor complex and bought hot dogs and chips from a kiosk, and ate them while defending the food from unruly birds, one did swoop in and steal a mouthful from baby. We exited via the rocket garden, took photos against the NASA logo, and headed to hotel check-in.

We stayed overnight at Cape Canaveral, where the hotels are basic and overpriced – the Radisson Country Inn and Suites was average in every sense of the word. We were low on food, so I did a 10pm trip to Publix for fruit and bread and snacks while Sam got Conway to sleep. Tomorrow we’d drive north to Georgia.

---

We left Cape Canaveral early, the SpaceX rocket still firmly on the ground, the Hyundai tank full, our bellies full of coffee, pancakes and bacon. Conway was strapped in the back with plenty of toys to entertain him – an iPad with games, balls, fresh fruit snacks, and mummy to assist.

The drive from Cape Canaveral to Jekyll Island in Georgia is simple – get on route 95 and keep going. The road is flat, the lanes are wide, there’s not much traffic and it’s 3 hours and 230 miles. The most boring drive, thankfully an easy one, with the same injury lawyer billboards and Christian radio stations.

We played Spotify and listened to podcasts while hurtling past Daytona, St Augustine and through Jacksonville, up to the border, over swamp lands and countryside into Georgia, where great advertising towers told us about fast food stops. We stopped half way, at a lunch spot – toilets and picnic benches and wide open country, it was pleasant. Birds wanted to steal our cold pizza.

## Jekyll Island

Why Georgia? We spent many weeks trying to work out how to spend the remainder of our time in Florida. We didn’t want to do all the theme parks, it’s not our thing. We love nature and Florida has plenty of wildlife, parks, and birding – but most of it seemed only accessible by boat – specifically kayak, and there’d be mosquitos a plenty – not something we wanted to tackle with an 18 month old. Most of the hotels seemed large and faceless, we wanted something with a bit of character. When we expanded our search to just outside of state we discovered the golden isles.

Our destination was Jekyll Island, part of Georgia’s golden isles region – together with St. Simons, Little St Simons, Sea Island and Brunswick town. It’s an area full of nature and American history. Jekyll island is connected to the mainland with a bridge, and the whole area is a state park – though there are houses, and golf courses and hotels around the island, they are limited.

We paid to enter the park, stopped for a much needed loo break, and continued onwards to our hotel – Jekyll Island Club Resort, where we’d stay for 4 nights.

## Jekyll Island Club Resort

There’s a snaking drive up to the hotel, along the water’s edge and through the limbs of overhanging oaks, Spanish moss draped everywhere, gently waving in the wind. As the trees clear the spire of the club house appears, an old building, frequented by the old rich Americans – like Rockefeller and Vanderbilt. Staff nip about in golf carts, patrons on green rented bicycles. In a quaint colonial room with two belt driven fans whirring above us we checked in. Conway pointed at the fans in excitement. We arrived early and our room was ready.

It had two queen sized beds and a cot, a TV above a grand fireplace and antique fittings. It opened out onto an enclosed balcony, this overlooked the croquet field and collected the sun’s heat throughout the day – we mostly used it for drying wet swimwear.

We were starving, so headed to The Pantry for a late lunch – a Reuben and a Cuban sandwich plus iced coffee. There were no baby seats, so we took turns minding Conway as he ran up and down the decking – blocking his path whenever he veered towards the steps. There were steps everywhere – no such thing as step-free access, meaning Conway couldn’t run free, and when we ventured out with a buggy it was a pain to get in and out of the room.

The Wharf and the splinter
In the afternoon we explored the grounds, poked our head into the grand dining hall, unpacked our things, and generally relaxed. Just beyond the hotel lies the water’s edge, there’s a jetty and a restaurant – [The Wharf](http://jekyllwharf.com), where we sat down for an early dinner.

We were seated near the back, with a view out over the water – the water was calm, reeds poked through the surface, seabirds flew by and the waitresses cooed at baby, “buh bye”, Conway would say when they walked by. We ordered food and Conway shared bits of ours – a concoction of burger and seafood surf and turf:

{% menu %}
- Jekyll Boil – Georgia shrimp, clams, crawfish, red-skinned potatoes, sweet corn, vidalia onion, smoked sausage
- A Wharf burger with fries
{% endmenu %}

When he grew restless I took him outside to give Samantha a bit of peace and quiet. He’s recently been walking up and down while running his hand along a handrail – only on the jetty the wooden rail was old, dry wood that was splitting up – meaning inevitably he got a splinter deep in his finger.

Cue the end of dinner, the search for tweezers and tears and patience as we remove it.

Once Conway was asleep we treated ourselves to room service and desserts – the course we missed out on. Beneath the dim light of a lampshade in our room, we indulged in ice cream and soufflé.

---

This morning we’d have our first breakfast in The Grand Hall – a decadent dining room with ornate chairs, polished tables, chandeliers, a grand piano and oil paintings. They serve a buffet breakfast and we picked out cheese grits, scrambled egg and cheese, bacon and sausage, and all the pastries. Conway ate cantaloupe and Rice Crispies with a cold glass of milk.

There are stairs everywhere in this hotel, and just outside the hall Conway discovered a set of 4 flights that were easy to climb and carpeted. “Stairs”, he says, and points, we climb a bit, passers by smile, “more stairs”, he repeats. We climb up and down, again and again, and we get to the top and he’s lost and can’t find mummy, so we come back down. This happened most mornings.

## Bike ride

At the back of the hotel there’s a bike rental shop, we got ourselves a pair of turquoise green bikes without brakes – well they had a kind of brake – if you cycled backwards it’d stop you. On the back of mine we hitched a trailer for Conway to sit in and put on his tiny helmet.

Jekyll Island is flat and there’s a few different cycle routes to take – we fancied a loop around the island and followed the recommended path – heading north, along the bay. A winding but paved walk skirts between old oaks and dangling moss, it runs along past the tiny airport and the electric buggy rental shop, and through beautiful woodland. Red northern cardinals sung in the branches above us.

Conway was either loving it, or a bit grizzly, we stopped for a snack, and soon enough he fell asleep – head hanging over the straps, we kept repositioning him so he’d be more comfortable. We stopped again by a wildlife reserve, for snacks and drinks, flocks of grey pelicans flew low over the water.

In the reserve the path turned to dust, and the trees disappeared – we hit the shadeless bit at midday. A family from Atlanta stopped to chat to us about all things British – like Dr Who, they asked why we’d come here, of all places. The reserve ended and opened onto a path with a bench, a place to stop and breastfeed while I explore the driftwood beach.

The sea has been encroaching on old oak forests, when the salt water reaches the tree and its roots it dies, but the tree remains, its roots buried deep. Over time the wood gradually erodes and falls down and gets pulled away – unless a hurricane swings by and takes out a swathe of them.

By now we were in the middle of nowhere and hungry for lunch. We consult the map and carry on along to Driftwood restaurant, but it’s closed. Thankfully there’s a small shop inside selling sandwiches and Starbucks Frappe which we ate by a swimming pool.

The remainder of our cycle was less exciting, our route took us out around the island past a residential area – by single storey bungalows with wide garages, mailboxes pitched out front. The houses turned to shops, and feeling tired, we took a shortcut across the island back to the hotel, following the road that cuts through two golf courses.

As we cycle back the sky turned grey, a wind picks up, and as soon as we park the bikes and take off our helmets the heavens opened. A perfectly timed narrow miss – yet behind us others were just renting their bikes and setting out into the downpour.

## Dinner at The Grand Hall

With all the rain, we didn’t fancy going far, so decided to make a 6pm reservation for The Grand Hall. There’s a smart dress code, so we dressed up in suits, a dress and Conway wore a waistcoat and tie – there was some benefit to having all these smart wedding clothes with us. Conway’s rose bear joined us – a bear that carries a rose.

Sam had lobster (5oz Filet and Lobster tail), and I had pork, and we celebrated with prosecco – Conway raised his glass of water and we clincked our glasses, “cheers”, we did this about six times. For dessert, a key lime torte.

Outside the clouds had clearer, and the evening treated us to a sublime orange sunset. We watched the sun go down as a family, and played on the path – Conway ran up and down with mummy’s handbag. We were having a lovely evening until our poor boy tripped and fell – a proper face plant, bit his lip, hurt his head and had a bloodied nose. An abrupt end to romance and tranquility as we rushed back to the room for ice and towels.

---

This morning we dined again in the grand hall, with Sam opting for an a la carte breakfast option – Steak before 9am. Outside the skies were blue and temperatures rising, but the forecast told us the weather would cloud over, so we spent the morning by the pool while we could. Conway enthusiastically covered us all in sun lotion, and we coaxed him into the pool with his pink ball. We had hot dogs for lunch.

## Georgia Sea Turtle Center

When the skies had turned grey we headed to the Georgia Sea Turtle Center – an operational vet and sanctuary (and very much not a zoo) in the grounds of Jekyll Island Club Resort. Conway has been learning macaton through Sing and Sign, and one of his favourite signs is the one for turtle. Turtles are very exciting right now, so a trip to see some real ones was a perfect little excursion.

Inside, we heard a talk about terrapins, and Conway got to see a little one up close. Around the walls we read about the different kinds of turtles, the problems they face, how they breed, how they lay eggs, who predates the eggs, and what they eat. High above were life sized models of each turtle species – a comparison showing just how big the Leatherback and Green turtles are. One tank holds a solitary turtle that mesmerises passers by, and a large window looks into the veterinary operating theatre.

The vets were at work – operating on a snake of all things. We held Conway up so he could see, “ssss” he said, shaking his hand, his word and sign for snake. They were taking blood from its tail end, while two people held it. It’s skin was beginning to flake off too, clearly ready to shed, the vets gave it a helping hand.

Out the doors at the back and around, we headed to the sanctuary – where pools held a variety of injured and recuperating sea turtles, mostly green turtles and loggerheads right now. Conway saw them, and did the turtle sign excitedly. A woman talked us through the ailments and story of each turtle; many are brought here from further north after getting caught out in cold water and suffering from shock, while others are injured by boats or other human causes.

## Eighty ocean kitchen and bar

For dinner we headed across the island to Eighty ocean. It’s a relaxed restaurant with a Table shuffleboard along one wall – a sand covered board with weights, a game like bowls where you send your weights from one end to the other with a delicate push. I held Conway at the right height, gathered up all the weights, showed him how to do it, then watched him practice, one at a time, then two at a time, my arm growing heavy as I hold him.

We sat near the back and watched the kitchen prepare plates. Conway shared a bit of each of our meals, mostly devouring my vermicelli noodles like they were spaghetti. We were a little too full after a delicious warm cheesecake dessert, with plenty of sugar and ice cream.

{% menu %}
- Jekyll bowl: Rice vermicelli, pork belly, shrimp, corn, edamame, ginger broth, chicken, copped cashews
- Fried soft shelled crab special
- Classic courtyard fried cheesecake: Flour tortilla, cinnamon sugar, macerated berries
{% endmenu %}

Eighty ocean backs onto a sandy beach that looks East, out onto the Atlantic. We took off our shoes and wandered out onto the sandy shores. Once again the island treated us to a spectacular sunset; the skies turned to fire – the clouds were like a wave of burning flames, before they turned a deep purple, like the world had oversaturated itself. By the sea we played in the soft waves, Conway giggled and shrieked when each wave touched his toes. The gentle sounds of the sea, birds, and laughter, a magical moment, and what holidays are made for.

---

Our last full day on Jekyll Island, tomorrow we’d be returning to Florida. So today we tried out somewhere new for breakfast – returning to Eighty Ocean for an a la carte option; scrambled eggs in spicy tacos, fried potatoes, omelette, pastries and a fruit bowl. We were stuffed.

## The Wanderer

Today we used the car to explore parts of the island we hadn’t seen yet – heading South to the tail end of the island first – and to St Andrew’s, a picnic area, and site of an atrocity. In 1858 a ship called The Wanderer landed here. It was an illegal slave ship, and it carried 487 Africans in horrific conditions for 42 days before arriving at Jekyll Island. Efforts have been made to find the survivors, and a walk along a sandy trail tells their story.

We followed the path and learnt their story; there were old instruments fashioned from available materials – which Conway played with, details of their cuisine – okra (or gumbo), a music box played “Watch that Star” – a song about following the North Star to escape the south – Conway danced to the tune.

## Horton Pond

We drove North again, and found Horton pond. It’s more of a small lake than a pond, and the perfect place to stop and look for wildlife, to listen to the sway of the trees and the songs of the birds, and to search for alligators. We’d keep Conway in the stroller.

As we arrived at the wooden platform overlooking the pond, we spied a ridged back in the water, heading our way. An alligator was coming right towards us. In the water too were terrapins and peculiar looking softshell turtles with long snouts. Through the water’s surface we could also see fish, some a few feet long. Egrets flew in the trees at the water’s edge.

From the pond we headed out on a short trail, perhaps 2km, the Tupelo trail is a loop through the forest where placards told us about the flora; deerberries and sparkleberries (a wild blueberry), live oaks, water oaks, sand live oaks and black tupelo – hence the trail’s name. We pushed Conway along the leaf-strewn paths, wary of flying insects, and keeping to the shade. He slept and we enjoyed the peacefulness of nature.

Before leaving we stopped again at the pond’s platform, we found the alligator had returned, and a baby, perhaps a foot long, was swimming about too. It’s unlikely we could get much closer to a wild alligator, at least not safely. And as we left, another wildlife sighting, and one that left me glad that baby remained in the stroller; from the path I spotted a black raised head, motionless, like a dark tree branch, it was an adult banded water snake. We stopped and watched until it slithered back into the undergrowth.

## Afternoon by the pool

All that walking at noon left us hot and sweaty; a function was happening at our hotel’s pool, so we went instead to the Jekyll Ocean club again, to use their swimming pool. Conway sat at the water’s edge with his cups, pouring water from one to the other, and back again, an activity that occupied him for a good hour.

## Driftwood dinner

For our last evening meal in Georgia we went to Driftwood bistro, a local place you can’t book in advance – first come first served, it offers “Low country cuisines and local shrimp dishes”. The walls are adorned with angular fish sculptures carved from old driftwood.

We got there early and sat down in the middle – just in time for Conway to nod off again – we’d be having a quiet dinner to ourselves. This was the perfect place to try a very good blackened shrimp and grits, and it was scrumptious.

“Wild Georgia shrimp and grits: White wine sauce with sautéed mushrooms, leeks, country ham and roasted peppers, over traditional garlic-cheddar cheese grits and topped with blackened wild Georgia shrimp, served with a signature side”

And the side was something special too: Sweet potato soufflé. Yes, soufflé. Back in Longboat key we’d been told about sweet potato casserole – a very sweet dish of sweet potato, almost like a dessert, but eaten as a side dish. This was similar – sugary sweet potato mash, a crumble-like topping and a dash of cinnamon, it was amazing.

Post-dinner we all headed to driftwood beach for some sunset photography. Of course the day we wanted to take pictures the sunset was rather average. We still made the most of it, posing for family portraits on a fallen oak, and getting shots of a tree growing from the waves, before dashing back to the car because of a freak rain shower. I returned shortly after to try a few more shots, which was a mistake if only because the rain had brought out the flies, and the no-see-ums as they’re called, covered my legs and left me with a good 20 bites. Yes, they bite, I’d assumed they didn’t. Still, it’s nice to help out the local ecology. Ha.

Our last day in Georgia, today we’d be driving south again, back to Orlando for our last couple of days. Just one more breakfast in the grand dining room – some more scrambled eggs and cheese, bacon, sausages, cheese grits, and so on. Outside a storm was passing through, rain hammered the windows, little waterfalls formed from the gutters. No golf today, the couple next to us looked dejected.

We packed up the last few bits, perused the shops and bought trinkets and toys from the Sea Turtle Center and subs from The Pantry as a lunchtime snack. We left around midday, and I stressed about hitting Orlando around rush hour – completely forgetting that it was Sunday.

Goodbye Jekyll island, goodbye Georgia, we pulled away and began our 3 hour drive south. Just after Jacksonville we hit rain – “this is pretty heavy” I thought, turning the wipers to top speed, spray killing the visibility. Florida gets heavier storms than us, I thought. Then the rain kicked up a notch, it hammered on the roof of the car, there was half a second between the wipers where I could see anything, surface water pooled on the road. This was getting difficult. Swish, swish, hammer, hammer – each bridge we passed under reminded us how noisy the rain was. Then the rain found another level – and now everyone slowed to a crawl, 20mph, hazards on. It lasted an hour, numerous cars had spun off onto the grassy verges, one car was upside down. Conway slept through it all.

We arrived at our hotel, Point Hotel and Suites, near Universal Blvd. On the TV the local news showed the extent of the spring storm – “Record rainfall in Daytona”, the newsreader said, “tornado touchdown”, I heard. Tomorrow’s forecast said sunshine.

---

From our new base in Orlando we left early, heading East, to arrive again in Cape Canaveral, to be there when the Kennedy Space Center opens – to make the most of our second day there. We parked at the front of the Scott Parker car park – beneath azure blue skies we skipped towards the entrance, our KSC lanyards around our neck, we watched the famous clock countdown the seconds until opening, the national anthem played, Florida’s love bugs covered everyone and thing, and the doors opened.

From the entrance, through the flying bug infestation, around to the Shuttle Atlantis exhibit. We were going to see a real space ship, something that had been to space and back over and over again – a monumental piece of human history. We were first in, and the place was perfectly quiet – a security guard ushered us into a large room and a  film began to tell us the story of the space shuttle.

It’s a launch shuttle piggybacking on a rocket, it’s a space ship and it’s a glider; we watched as the paper prototype was developed into the real thing, tested, redesigned, improved, delayed, over budget, retested, redesigned and built again, until it was ready. The video ends, double doors open, and we’re in another room, a larger room, with screens all around us.

The story continues, and videos from floor to ceiling show the first launch, deployment in space, construction of the space station, the Hubble telescope, and untethered spacewalks – a dramatic taste of the shuttle’s legacy – the lights dim, stars appear, and in front of us the bay doors open, revealing Space Shuttle Atlantis as though suspended in space, mid-mission, floating high above the earth.

Conway ran forward, teddy bear in hand, pointing at the space plane, with an expression that said “look at that”, and not quite sure what to make of it. And there it was, the real thing, a symbol of my 90s childhood, such a joy to look at.

The guide recommends 2 hours for the exhibit, we almost topped 4. We stood and admired, explored, and listened to detailed tours showcasing the design features – from the crew quarters to the thrusters and heat shielding. We played in the mock-up cockpit and Conway had his turn at piloting. We tried an augmented reality space station docking, and a video showed how Hubble was deployed and also fixed – besides a life sized replica of the telescope. We crawled around the tubes of an imitation space station and Conway rolled the giant space shuttle tyres. Sam added “besides the space shuttle”, to the locations where she’s breastfed.

We saw the poignant memorial to the two disasters, Challenger and Columbia.

Outside, back in the bright glare of daylight and the heat of Florida, we grabbed ourselves some lunch – coffee, burgers and chips and key lime pie for dessert. With Conway now asleep we considered an IMAX movie, but just missed one – instead we looked around the Space Now exhibit – showing plans for the upcoming space launch system, Boeing’s spacecraft prototypes, and a real SpaceX dragon capsule.

Near the IMAX Samantha stayed with Conway to watch a science presentation on a 3D globe, while I tried out the shuttle launch simulator – a ride in a chair that moves you around and shakes you a lot.

In the Journey to Mars exhibit a loud presentation called for participants in the Mars programme - the first person to stand on Mars could be in this room, Conway cried with all the loud noises. Bathed in red light were descriptions of robots, prototypes, and the problems facing any Mars crew. In the corner – life sized replicas of the Mars Rovers; Sojourner, Opportunity and Spirit, and the most ambitious of all – the giant Curiosity, larger than I’d imagined.

From the future legends of Mars exploration, to America’s legends of space travel – we whisked around the Hall of Fame – I kept Conway entertained with a GoPro besides reproductions of old mission control, and a real Gemini 9A capsule – the interactive video was too noisy and scary for Conway. Of course, in a wide open space to run around in our little boy found the one sharp edge to knock his head on.

Outside again, and Conway and I played in a soft play area while Sam had a guided tour of the rocket garden. In places like this Samantha goes into full “museum mode”, she becomes a sponge that must soak up every wonderful fact from every exhibit, she is thorough and sees and reads everything. I only wish I had the energy to do the same.

The last event of the day was a talk given in the Universe Theater, a 3D show guiding us through the universe to look at some of the wonders our telescopes have discovered. Conway had his own glasses, but in the dark of the theater he mostly breast-fed.

And now our time here was over, we battled the love bugs as we left, and drove back to Orlando – stopping at Publix for some food reserves – we’d found the British aisle and here in the US we enjoyed a good old plate of British beans on toast. “Beans” Conway said, as excited about beans as he might be about space.

## A day at Disney World

We needed to return to Orlando for our flight home. We’d booked a couple of nights here, initially so we could do 2 days at the Kennedy Space Center – but having squeezed an extra day in earlier in our trip, we now found ourselves with a free day in Orlando. Disney World was the obvious choice.

The night before we downloaded the mobile app, purchased our Magic Kingdom day tickets for $120 each, reserved a table for two with baby at the Be Our Guest restaurant and prepared packed lunches and breakfasts.

We got up and out early, the resort opens at 9am but they let you in early, and it can take an hour to get from the car park to the gates. We left our nearby hotel at 7am with bags loaded full of bagels, cantaloupe and sausages from breakfast. Avoiding the worst of Orlando’s rush hour, we snaked our way through the road systems that lead to the Disney resorts – following signs for Magic Kingdom, and parking in the Simba area. The skies were a beautiful azure blue, and even at 8am the temperatures were soaring.

## Welcome

An unending procession of people led the way to the park, through security and to the transport links – we boarded the monorail with Conway in buggy, and set off around the Seven Seas Lagoon, Cinderella’s famous castle loomed in the distance. We took the downtime to lather ourselves in sun lotion. From the monorail we clicked through the turnstiles, scanned our mobile tickets – and we were in – heading down Main Street USA.

From the colonial buildings of Jekyll Island, to the stylised over the top old town of Disney, a high street lined with store after store of merchandise, old cars whisking guests up and down it, all leading to that world famous view of the Disney castle. Hundreds of people poured down the street, and we all gathered by the castle to wait for the opening performance. Nearing 9am and it was hot, very hot, the sun was lightly grilling our shoulders.

We parked ourselves beneath the bronze statue of Walt and Mickey,  and we watched the mice and the princesses welcome us, the fairy godmother cast a spell from a high window of the castle – and the park was open.

## Enchanted Tales With Belle

Unsure what rides we could and couldn’t do with Conway, we walked first to Fantasyland and were the first to enter the Enchanted Tales With Belle – an interactive performance. As would become ritual – we parked the stroller, took bags with our essentials and carried Conway to the ride. And this was our first taste of Disney air-con – each ride, ride line and shop gets pumped with cold air to cool everyone down – aircon is the hook that pulls you into the shops, making it almost pleasurable to buy overpriced merch.

We passed through double doors into Belle’s father’s workshop. Maurice is an inventor, and around us were sketches and examples of his work. In front a magic mirror, which we’d pass through into a tale of how Belle met the beast. A talking wardrobe assigned us roles to play – she moved her head and eyes in a lifelike way – Samantha and Conway got the role of Mrs Potts, while I cringed inside.

Through another door and Lumiere welcomed us, his candelabra arms waving and gesturing, his French accent setting the scene. Belle soon arrived, and we played out the story, children super excited, staff slightly jaded.

## Under the Sea

Still early, and with queue times only 5 minutes, we hopped from Belle’s story to Ariel’s. Our first actual ride. The line led us around displays showing the mermaid’s human collectibles and the noisy seagull welcomed us. We sat down in a seashell, Conway snuggled between us, and set off on an underwater journey – Sebastian the lobster sung to us, Ariel and Flounder danced, and we watched the retelling of their story. We pointed out each fish and octopus and starfish to Conway, he was wide eyed and quiet, taking it all in but not sure what to make of it – occasionally he pointed with excitement. Down where it’s wetter segued into Poor unfortunate souls, then Kiss the girl, and out to the wedding finale.

Time for breakfast, and we perched outside Gaston’s Tavern, eating our sausages and pancakes, and listening to others talk about certain rides being closed – all the big rides hadn’t opened yet – Space mountain, Splash mountain and so on – this didn’t bother us much, except that it meant queues at the quieter rides were now longer.

## Dumbo the flying elephant

Staying in Fantasyland, the next ride we’d try was a little more exhilarating – a spinning flying elephant ride. You sit inside a little Dumbo and spin up and around, a little lever controlling how high you go. A half an hour queue now, but inside we waited in a faux-circus soft play area – a beeper would tell us when it was our turn to board. And Conway enjoyed sitting and driving a little car as all the other kids rushed about around him.

Beep, beep, it was our time to board. We squeezed in, Conway tightly in the middle – immediately drawn to the lever, and off we go – spinning around, and around, up and down, Conway enjoyed every moment, while daddy felt queasy by the end.

Now nearing midday, we stopped again at Gaston’s to buy some drinks and eat our homemade packed lunch – delicious pickle and pastrami subs, saving us about $30 and  tasting superior. Inside the tavern a fake fireplace roared, while the aircon whirred, in Gaston’s giant seat a mother was breastfeeding, the perfect throne for it.

## Exploring the park

Time to leave Fantasyland, and beneath the hot sun, sun lotion lathered on again, we set out to explore the rest of the park – walking West into Frontierland, then Adventureland, screams fell from Splash mountain, horns bellowed from the steam boat, families wore matching Disney t-shirts and Mickey ears were everywhere. We hopped from shop to shop to keep cool – from the haunted house to Ye Olde Christmas Shoppe.

We passed from Adventureland, and the Swiss Robinson tree, back across in front of Cinderella’s castle and into the underwhelming Tomorrowland – a 60s future looking a little dated, and where bottled water will cost you $3.50. Of course we had refillable bottles and the park is full of water fountains.

## Iced coffee and tea cups

Back on the periphery of Fantasyland, clearly this is where we wanted to be, we cooled down with a tasty iced coffee, booked a ride on Winnie the Pooh using our FastPass and headed towards the Mad Hatter’s Mad Tea Party.

After feeling too queasy on Dumbo I opted to watch this one, I don’t mind rollercoasters, I don’t like spinning. Sam stayed in line with Conway, and I watched them board a yellow cup in the middle. A mouse poked its head out the top of the ride, Conway pointed to it, and the cups began to spin, round and around, I watched as they zipped by, again and again, both clearly having a lot of fun.

## Pirates not bears

When it was time to join Pooh bear’s journey through the 100 Acre Forest the ride broke down. Our FastPass got switched to a generic one we could use on anything, and we chose to go on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride – we crossed back to Adventureland for it.

We meandered through and around the FastPass waiting area, still queuing for 15 minutes before getting our turn. “Is this ride ok for babies?”, we’d asked at the entrance – “yes, there’s no height restriction”. We boarded a boat and set out into the darkness, unsure what to expect.

Around a corner, and there were pirates, and villagers, and hearty singing, and cannons and gunshots, water splashes and animatronic dogs. Conway screamed with each bang, upset, but not overwhelmed, a little fake cat or dog calmed him quickly, and the ride continued. Then in the darkness, a surprise drop, we whistled down a short hill, completely unexpected, it was fun for Conway and I, but Sam’s heart was in her mouth.

All in all though, the ride was a bit of a wet flop, there was a Pirate with a strong resemblance to Jack Sparrow, but not much of a story, you wouldn’t want to wait long for it. Winnie the Pooh would have been better. Still, the cool air conditioned darkness was a welcomed break from the blazing hot sunshine.

## A parade and an island

And back out in that sun, where adult and children alike were turning the colour of Minnie’s dress, we found ourselves amongst a full on parade.  Merida from Brave danced upon a dragon, Minnie and Mickey rode a balloon, a giant Dumbo float was surrounded with dancers. Everyone must melt in those outfits.

When the music had passed we escaped the hustle and bustle for the quiet tranquility of Tom Sawyer Island. From a wooden raft we climbed onto the green hill – the noises, music and screaming of Disney World now only a soft din, we explored the island like it was some National Trust walk – from the windmill, through the mine, over the water,  to the imaginary boat, we let Conway roam free as much as we could.

## Be our Guest

We’d booked the only table available when we did it online last night, and that was 5pm. We hadn’t expected to get in, the Lonely Planet had suggested booking months in advance. It was nice to know we had dinner planned.

From Tom Sawyer’s island we approached the bridge to The Beast’s castle, where we waited with anticipation in front of two large wooden doors – enormous lions sitting either side, staring down at us. A lady greeted us, welcome to the castle and our restaurant, she gave Conway a sticker, and the giant doors opened for us.

We walked through, past a beautiful mural of Belle and her prince, into the grand ballroom. While it didn’t have the tranquility or intimacy I’d expected, it was still magical. A balcony ran around the edge of the room, large chandeliers hung from the ceiling, and at the back a large window opened onto a winter’s landscape, snow was falling in the night.

We were seated in the main hall, but there were two other rooms as well – one contained a giant spinning figurine of Belle and The Beast, with paintings of their life together adorning the walls, while the other was all the more impressive – a dark room resembling The Beast’s despair – a magical rose drooped in the corner, a portrait was torn by bear claws and drapes were ripped to shreds, a tapestry on the wall told the story.

It was a 3 course set menu – Sam chose Escargot (snails) with a center-cut Filet Mignon, I had a gruyere and onion soup followed by pork tenderloin. Everyone’s desserts were the same – a trio, include a white chocolate chip cup filled with matcha cream. Every now and then The Beast walked by, welcoming us to his castle.

## Fireworks

Every night at Disney World the day ends with a fireworks show. After our meal at The Beast’s we ambled back to Main Street – the sun had set and the temperature was at last comfortable. We explored some more of the Disney stores before finding a space in front of the castle for the final show – we parked right in the middle, with a perfect view of Cinderella’s place. The finale starts at 9.

We sat and waited, as the sky grew dark and the castle’s lights began to dazzle. I was expecting a 5 minute fireworks display – but it was a full half hour show, it began with music and a choreographed light show onto the castle, then well timed explosions of fireworks in time with the performance.

Big Disney show numbers were accompanied by dancing animated characters projected onto the spires and windows of the castle. All the villains, then the heroes took turns in lights, from Moana, Aladdin and The Little Mermaid, to Toy Story and Pirates of the Caribbean. Tinkerbell appeared in a window and flew out and above the crowds to rapturous applause as fireworks crashed and popped on either side of the castle.

With one last hurrah, the castle explodes in a flurry of light, colour and music, “follow your dreams” they say, and the show ends, A phenomenal light show, and the perfect serenade to the end of our holiday to Florida and Georgia. A little bit of magic to end with.

We followed the crowds out of the park, and boarded the boat across the water, back to our car, and back to our hotel – 15 hours later, an epic day. Tomorrow we would pack, hang by the pool, drive back to the airport, return our trusty rental and fly home again to Brighton – an 8 hour flight with an infant, it could have been worse. From the wedding and family time in Longboat key, to the alligators and pelicans, the great rockets in the space center, the swinging Spanish moss and old American architecture of Jekyll island, and the thrills and magic of a day at Disney – a fantastic holiday.
