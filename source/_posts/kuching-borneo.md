Kuching was the first of three stops in Borneo, a “sophisticated and chic city” surrounded with luscious natural parks, all within easy day-visit reach. We’d be in Kuching for four days, staying at the LimeTree hotel, highest rated on Trip Advisor. A white minibus picked us up from the airport, “Just two?” our driver asked. On the surface, and compared to Kuala Lumpur, the city is small, and beyond the golden crowned Sarawak State Assembly and pointed library, it looked like there wasn’t much to do. Equally, switching from five star business luxury to a modest but quirky and characterful hotel was a shock to the system. Nonetheless, we loved everything about this city and this hotel, and we could have stayed twice as long — there’s so many places to see and places to eat. It exudes a relaxed charm, not unlike [Hoi An in Vietnam](/2012/12/hoi-an-vietnam/), or even [Paraty in Brazil](/2011/12/paraty-brazil/).

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Kuching at night](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/kuching-109.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/kuching-109.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Kuching at night</figcaption></figure>

The LimeTree hotel takes a lime theme and runs with it, skips with it, hops with it, and then drop kicks it into some sort of lime shaped net. Everything is green; sofas, doors, pillows, toiletries. Drinks are served on green trays with felt green lining. The free welcome drink is a lime soda, made from homegrown limes. Cocktails all have a lime twist. Lime trees decorate the bar and foyer. Then there are the perfect lime puns, the downstairs restaurant named “Sublime”, the rooftop bar “Limelight”. The shop sells boiled lime sweets and aprons bearing the lyric, “I’ve had the lime of my life”. Juicy.

With so much to do we were diligent in our plans. Within an hour of arriving we’d booked the Bumbu cooking class for Thursday, met the cook (“chef” is a protected title) and paid our deposit. Tomorrow we’d visit Bako national park, and Friday we’d probably go to Kubah national park. The hotel offered tours through companies to these places, but they cost upwards of £50 each. Instead we organised a taxi pick-up and drop off, we’d do it ourselves for a fraction of the price.

Settled, unpacked, and over the newly found [crack on the camera’s screen](http://instagram.com/p/lq8qBfNFCw/ "Instagram") (fixed with some sticky tape from reception), we ventured out into late-afternoon Kuching. From the hotel you can walk along the riverfront into town, it’s a pleasant 10 minute stroll if the sun isn’t trying to melt you. On the opposite riverbank is the prestigious Sarawak assembly, it looks gorgeous, though it’s not worth crossing the river to see inside. The air was filled with the sounds of bad karaoke coming from across the river.

From the waterfront promenade we found new chinatown and the main bazaar. T-shirts bore the Sarawak emblem of a hornbill bird, wrapped in a green Starbucks-esque circle. Shops overflow onto the paths, and there are many cultural craft shops and galleries, some with classic or antique carvings that are both mysterious and frightening. Little stalls on the roadside sell Kek Lapis, tasty layer cakes of all flavours, from chocolate to bright green pandan leaves — tastings are free and we must have bought at least four of these lovely treats. Though the canned “winter melon” and “green tea jasmine” soft drinks were so weird we only took two sips, then bought ice cream and more drinks to washout the flavour.

For dinner we felt adventurous, looking for some authentic and radical local cuisine. Dyak seemed perfect, it specialises in traditional Dayak recipes — concoctions of flavours with fresh rainforest vegetables that are unheard of. Dayak is a collective term for the indigenous tribesfolk of Borneo. Photos of tribes and traditional tribal acts adorned the walls, alongside oil paintings and peculiar spiralling murals. We started by knocking back a shot of Tuak Indu each, a local fortified rice wine. We weren’t sure how much to order, but dishes were cheap, so we ended up with much more than we could eat but with a bit of everything we wanted.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Paku kubok (Giant jungle ferns — midin, stir fried with wild ginger flowers, anchovies and chillies)
*   Tilapia gulai terung dayak asam terjun (Spicy tilapia soup — with fish head, and orange egg-plant)
*   Ulam raja (Shallots, wild ginger flower, ginger, lemongrass, lots of chillies, anchovies, lime)
</div>

The curly jungle ferns tasted odd, both fresh and pithy. Wild ginger flower is quite delicious.

After a traditional Sarawak Laksa breakfast at Sublime, we took the LimeTree minibus to Bako national park, for our first foray into the rainforests of Borneo. Bako national park is a peninsula that juts out into the South China sea, with protected coastline and mangrove forests, and it’s the best place to come and see the endangered Proboscis monkeys. It’s only a 40min drive from town and we were there by 7:30am. When you arrive there’s a small boat fee to take you around the coastline to the otherwise unreachable park HQ. We joined two french-canadians and a hungarian for the trip, and agreed to trek with them too.

On the drive in we passed through a heavy storm that lashed the minibus. We feared the day would be a washout; it remained overcast but the weather held out. We’d packed waterproofs just in case. They might have been handy for the boat trip too, had the sea not been so calm — waves still threatened to drench us. The boat arrived at a beach, it was low tide and the boat couldn’t get any closer; we had to hop out barefoot and wade to the wet sandy shore, where a thousand tiny crabs parted to let us through.

A friendly park-ranger (seemingly more knowledgable and helpful than the guides available at the boat port) had shown us the park trails and explained that the longer ones were closed due to flooding. Had we been thinking we might have hired his services. There’s over 17 trails available at the park, to begin we chose a short 3km trek (round trip) to a cove, the Telok Paku trail where, we were told, there’s a good chance of seeing monkeys.

Wild Bornean bearded pigs meander about park HQ — before leaving we’d past three; mud cakes the thick hairs on their back, and flies cling on as they trot about. Around their nose long wispy hair dangles down, a thick bikers beard. They sniff and snort at the grass, and approached us before walking away disinterested.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Wild bearded pigs at Bako park HQ](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/kuching-041.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/kuching-041.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Wild bearded pigs at Bako park HQ</figcaption></figure>

From HQ the trail took us out beyond the smart looking lodges, boat jetty and boardwalk. Beneath the boardwalk, on the sand below, were funky big-armed fiddler crabs, large-shelled hermit crabs and mudskipper fish.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Large hermit crab crawling along the beach](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/kuching-045.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/kuching-045.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Large hermit crab crawling along the beach</figcaption></figure>

When walking in the rainforest be watchful of where you tread and where you put your hands. Along the hand rails ants and termites run up and down, ferrying whatever it is they ferry; tree trunks you might lean on, or slip and grab, come with four inch spikes that could impale you; and curly, dangling wooden vines might, if you’re especially unlucky, be a snake waiting for dinner.

The trail was hard on the ankles, gnarly slippery tree roots are everywhere, puddles hide the depth of holes, and there’s a little bit of climbing too. As recommended we wore proper boots, long-sleeved shirts and light trousers, but by mid-morning we were dripping with sweat, sleeves and trousers rolled up and red-faced. At trails end, by the beach, we welcomed the cooling sea breeze.

We didn’t see any monkeys, and on the way back we passed many who told us, “they’re all hanging out at park HQ”. We hurried back, we were headed there anyway for lunch. By the education centre I caught sight of someone staring into a tree, “just a bunch of proboscis” she explained. Two female proboscis were in the tree, they had a golden orange face and back which turned grey along their limbs. A sharp pointed nose markedly sticks out. From the treetops they crashed down with a racket onto the corrugated roof and swung away into the foliage. Wow.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Female Proboscis monkeys at Bako national park](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/kuching-052.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/kuching-052.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Female Proboscis monkeys at Bako national park</figcaption></figure>

Park HQ’s cafeteria was better than expected, and everything was seemingly priced at 6rm. Refuelled and ready to go we started the 5.6km Lintrang tail, which we expected to finish in about 3 hours. A bit of a push, but we needed to get back for the last boat of the day. It follows the Telok Paku route and then forks off and completes a large circle around park HQ. The path goes sharply upwards and the environment changes, from lowland rainforest to a sandstone plateau and heath — without shade. We started slowly, keeping an eye out for wildlife, but in the first hour we’d only covered about 1.5km; we picked up the pace and practically marched the rest. Along paths knotted with tree roots, up slippery boulders, through stretches of barren sandstone, down wobbly old wooden steps, through shadowy rocks and past cave entrances. At some points the path was riverlike, flowing with a sandy bed and a couple of inches deep.

There were red and pink berries, wild orchids, pitcher plants and wild durian trees, but marching through we saw little wildlife. Until a sudden “whooping” noise stopped us. It was loud and it sounded alarmed, we tried to trace where it came from, and discover what it was — a big bird maybe? a mammal? Following a dirt trail, and squatting down at a clearing, looking out across the valley we spotted a large monkey, much bigger than most long-tailed macaques, but a macaque nonetheless. It was agitated and by itself, and kept glancing over to where we were, it was fascinating to watch. Though it was ‘only’ a macaque, it was a very personal and unique interaction with a wild jungle animal — one we’d spotted amongst the foliage; we were by ourselves, and this experience was ours alone, and that was tremendously exciting. It made the entire 5km walk worth it.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--video"><div class="video-wrapper"><iframe class="vimeo" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/95789071" width="620" height="413" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Video of long-tailed macaque</figcaption></figure>

Back down by park HQ, back with plenty of time to reach the boat, we stumbled on our friendly park ranger again, he was showing around some professional looking photographers. We tagged along; he pointed out some more naughty macaques, and then, in the trees next to us and by the beach, more proboscis monkeys. Much closer this time, happy to ignore us, we crept very close to get photos. A family of five or six, and an alpha male, with his huge bulbous nose, bulging belly and unmissable bright red ‘appendage’. They’d been hanging around park HQ for much of the afternoon, and we might’ve been better sticking around there, rather than getting sweaty on a trek-cum-sprint.

After watching these monkeys for too long, though not long enough for our liking, we really did have to rush. Leaving the proboscis on the beach, we rejoined our Canadian friends for the boat trip back, a little sad not to be staying the night — though we had many more nature treks planned. At the port our driver was waiting, and soon enough we were being whisked back to our hotel by minibus.

Now aching, our legs unwilling to take us very far, we ate dinner at the waterfront restaurant, “John Brookes Bistro”. Set back from the water amongst trees and a garden, it creates an idyllic open veranda, free from the hustle and bustle of the city right behind it. We can’t get enough local Laksa.

<div class="menu">

Back at the hotel’s rooftop bar we had lime caipiroska cocktails, and called it a night

<!--nextpage-->

Spending a day hiking through rainforest takes its toll. Both of us woke to aches and pains, but I had the bug bites to-boot. My hand was worst off, three bites between the knuckles.

Our muscles could relax today, we’d already booked cooking lessons at the Bumbu Cookery School. It’s in an older part of town, one room rented at the back of an old Chinese shop. It’s rudimentary, and as its rented they can’t do much to it (ie change the toilet!), but it makes do, perhaps it even adds to the authenticity. We were a group of five, a friendly dutchman, a mother (83) and daughter from New Zealand, and us two.

Before leaving for our market tour we needed to prepare our marinade for the first dish, a Sarawak chicken curry. All chicken is cooked on the bone; when the edge of the bone changes colour then it indicates that the meat is cooked. It also gives a better taste.

Our cook, (he said he can’t call himself chef, for that he’d need a license) explained that we’d be preparing dishes in the traditional Sarawak style, but where possible he’d provide details of ingredients we could buy locally when we got home. These cooking courses are a way for him to share his culture with others, and that seems to drive him. He’s from a small town, owns a farm, and collects durian species, and he’s a lovely friendly man.

With the chicken marinading we all clambered into a comfortable people-carrier and headed to the market. It was the cleanest, freshest, nicest Asian market any of us had seen. The market used to be in town, within walking distance, but it had recently moved to a dedicated new-build. Not quite as convenient though.

Our chef (I can call him that) explained all the weird and wonderful fresh things, whilst picking out the items we needed for our course, putting them in our cute wicker bags. There were long beans, snake beans, orange egg plants, pea sized egg plants, curry leaf, green peppercorns and fiddle head jungle ferns (in three stages of freshness — from good to slimy). Yams and tapioca, wild ginger flower and stems, sour prunes (or snakeskin prunes — so acidic it can cook fish), baby corn (still with its greenery) and sago flour. There was red wild star fruit, which has a thin flesh and edible seeds but is very sour. We needed ripe pineapple for our dish — you can tell ripeness by the green/yellow, we picked up some that were about half yellow half green. There were sour custard apples, which looked like deflated pineapples. In Sam’s bag was a bunch of pandan leaves — like a quiver with arrows, she swung about with them and narrowly avoided (or sometimes not) tickling passers by with the tips of the leaves.

From the fruit and veg aisles we moved to the meat and fish. A fishmonger posed with two enormous fresh water shrimp, and a man squeezed past us carrying a hundred chicken eggs. Piles and piles of crispy anchovies were on every table; the more expensive they are, the more crispy, “don’t scrimp on the anchovies”. Chef had already bought our chicken, “always buy meat first thing”.

The market was notably devoid of durian, and that rancid smell. Apparently they aren’t yet in season. Chef gave us a good tip too, if you smell of durian (should you have eaten it, you mad person!), you can wash your hands with water soaked in durian skin, which extracts the smell.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Enormous fresh water shrimp](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/kuching-072.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/kuching-072.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Enormous fresh water shrimp</figcaption></figure>

With ingredients ready, we drove back to the school to continue cooking. First up we made sweet tako boxes for our dessert. Using the pandan leaves we carefully folded and cut as instructed, creating 20 or so leafy boxes held together with a cocktail stick. Inside them we hid some sweetcorn (“a surprise”). Next we prepared coconut water by squeezing fresh coconut in a bowl of water, this formed part of a sugar and flour mixture which we stirred on a low heat until it bubbled. That became the dessert, we poured it over the sweetcorn and filled the boxes, and put in the fridge for later. Very simple and incredibly tasty. Best eaten fresh!

As a side to the chicken curry we prepared Sambal Midin, midin being fresh jungle ferns (asparagus makes a good alternative), and Sambal being a traditional pounded chilli paste. In a pestle and mortar we pounded dried chillies, shallots, shrimp paste and dried prawns — crushing the shallots into a paste is hardest and the Sambal is often judged by how small they are. Chef looked at mine, and gave me a look, no that’s not ready, pound harder. We prepped the ferns by pulling off the stalks. Cooking was simple enough; put in the paste, add the ferns and season.

To the main course, we fried our chicken with red chilli paste, white candle nut paste, brown cumin paste, turmeric paste and some dark brown bumbu paste, then onion, star anise and a pounded mix of lemongrass, ginger, galangal, garlic and shallots. We added water slowly and waited until the bone changed colour and the meat was cooked inside. We added lots more water, some fried potatoes and left for 20 minutes.

In the meantime we prepped some fresh pineapple. We’d always just cut off the edges, creating a lot of waste, chef explained that we can instead peal, then remove the eyes along the diagonal — leaving you with much more succulent pineapple to eat. By the time we’d finished prepping our curries were ready, we were starving, and we were ready to eat. The amount of food we’d cooked could feed 40, and I think the leftovers were taken to people that would eat it.

Around a table we devoured our feast; sarawak chicken curry, sambal midin, rice, coconut tako boxes, and fresh pineapple. Yummy! We were finished by 3pm, and of course, like all previous cooking courses, we bought a new apron before leaving.

Outside it was searing hot. Rather than traipse about in the heat we made our plans and reservations for tomorrow (a morning drive to Semeneggoh orangutan reserve, and an afternoon hike in Kubah national park). We didn’t do much after that, I relaxed in the hotel while Sam hunted down a good-looking wooden hornbill statue (it broke on the return flight, but nothing a bit of super glue couldn’t fix).

We met up again in the evening and checked out the lauded “Top Spot Food Court”. Sounds great, right? It’s also on the top of a concrete multi-storey car park and adorned with neon lights. Still, it has the best seafood in town, and the locals swear by it. But I wasn’t in the mood for fish, and Sam reluctantly agreed to find somewhere else.

While looking for ‘somewhere else’ we stumbled on an over-the-top traditional Chinese dance. It featured a dragon, held by 20 people who danced in a circle, to the tribal beat of drum. It spilled out from a grand Chinese pagoda into the road, blocking the streets, everyone filmed it on their smart phones.

Eventually we found the place we were looking for, “Bla bla bla”, described as “Innovative, chic and stylish … [with] Chinese-inspired fusion dishes” by the Lonely Planet. It was all of those things, minus the fusion (it was just Chinese). We couldn’t work out how much to order; after placing our order the kitchen gave word that we’d “ordered too much”. They were right, the utterly delicious crispy seaweed, fried rice and crispy duck were too much, and had we’d eaten an oyster pancake too we might have been unable to move. Sam’s choice of drink didn’t help, an enormous dessert-like coke float (I instead rekindled a taste for Longan juice). A glutton for punishment, we shared cheesecake for dessert too.

<!--nextpage-->

For our final day in Kuching we returned to wildlife based activities, most of our holiday was wildlife based. At 8am we were due a pick-up to get to Semenggoh for a 9am orangutan feeding (it takes about an hour). Today would be hectic as, instead of choosing one thing, we tried to squeeze in as much as we could. Right after the roundtrip to Semenggoh, one of our best chances of seeing orangutan during our holiday, we’d have 10 minutes or so to grab lunch from the hotel before hopping on another minibus taking us to Kubah (about 40 mins away), “the home of palms and frogs”, another sweaty jungle trek.

It didn’t start well though, at 8:20 there was still no sign of our pickup. The single activity we booked through an agency (rather than doing ourselves via our hotel taxi service), and we had problems. Turns out they’d been waiting for us in the wrong place. Nevermind, they found us, and they raced across town at speed to get us (and another woman called Sam — from Singapore) to the nature reserve in time. We made it, and we had a cheerful chat about life in Singapore and the UK on the way there.

When we wandered down the road to the reserve entrance we found the park ranger finishing up his spiel to a group of 50 or so others. We’d heard from a couple in our hotel that the orangutans weren’t playing ball, and hadn’t come out for feeding for a few days. (To be honest, that’s a good thing, it’s better that they don’t need to rely on food handouts — they are after all returning to their wild instincts). We all gathered by the feeding platform and waited, … and waited. For an hour the group was silent, patient, hopeful. But the ranger told us the apes were still several kilometres away, they weren’t hungry, and we wouldn’t see any furry orange monkeys today.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Waiting for orang-utan](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/kuching-078.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/kuching-078.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Waiting for orang-utan</figcaption></figure>

There used to be walking trails through the park, in the past you could have spent a day here, wandering the forests, looking for orangutans yourself. But there were ape attacks and the paths are now closed, seemingly for good. So after the feeding you’ve got to go. We could have come back for the afternoon feeding for free, but we had other plans. (We expected to see orangutans in Kota Kinabalu, and hoped to see some in Danum Valley).

The reserve also has some crocodiles in cages by the river. I don’t know why they are there, or why they are in cages. It was unsettling, as too were the crocodiles, sat there, staring, waiting to pounce, perfectly camouflaged; at first glance the cages looked empty — we completely missed the 8 foot reptile not five feet from us.

The journey back was to the tune of 90s mix radio, Alanis Morisette played us out. At the hotel we rushed in, ordered a tuna sandwich, picked up some things, changed our shoes, grabbed our food and dived into the minibus. Next stop Kubah.

Kubah national park is famous for its variety of frog and palm species (though the frogs are nocturnal and you need to stop the night if you want to see them). The park ranger was the most charismatic and friendly man we met in all of Malaysia. “The trails are easy, you won’t need a guide”, we’d already chosen the Waterfall trail; a 3km one-way trek from park HQ with a luscious swim-in-able pool and waterfall at the end of it. About 3 hours in total.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![A rufous piculet in Kubah national park](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/kuching-083.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/kuching-083.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">A [rufous piculet](http://www.projectnoah.org/spottings/242276082 "Project Noah") in Kubah national park</figcaption></figure>

The trail begins with an arduous walk up a steep paved road without any shade. In the early afternoon Sam really struggled; she was overheating, and almost gave up. For a little while we wondered if we’d missed our turn onto the dirt track, and the comfort of the shaded forest, the road seemed so long. We rested at the first point of interest, a man-made frog pond.

The forest felt noticeably more alive and dense than at Bako, more insects, more chirping and whistling, more Cicadas, and more wildlife we couldn’t see. The frog pond is man-made, but forms a breeding pool for many species of amphibian. While Sam cooled down I explored quietly. I didn’t get far before a barely visible web blocked my route. And I came face to face with the black spider that made it; it had an intriguing green striped abdomen. I saw three species of frog too, but I wouldn’t know how to identify them. I also knew that where there’s frogs there’s likely to be predators, such as snakes. I looked very carefully, I didn’t find one, but in a rotting tree trunk I found a recently-shed snake skin, about four foot long. It had red dots along one edge, possibly from a paradise tree snake.

When Sam had recovered we pressed on, eventually reaching the turn that took us into the depths of the rainforest. The trail begins with a sharp decline, made easier with concrete slab steps. As it levels out the path alters between old rotten wood and a dirt track, easier on the ankles than the root-laden Bako trail. Spindly spiders and ants rushed about the forest floor, and a sign warned us of dangerous bees (as well as stingless ones). Occasionally a giant bug would stop us in our tracks; a blue shielded centipede, then a mysterious giant millipede, over a foot long — it was in a rush somewhere and wouldn’t slow down for photos. Enormous strangling fig trees and endangered ironwood trees climb into the canopy above. Falling trees are common, and many had crashed to the forest floor, sometimes the trail was blocked and we had to go around. One had smashed through a low bridge we needed to cross; the trunk made a good substitute; another has taken down half a flight of steep wooden steps — again, we scrambled over the decaying trunk to get to the other side.

A slight rustling noise on a slope high above us made us look, and we watched as a small tree frog leaped down the hill toward us, its jumps were huge — covering metres at a time. It landed in front of us, briefly steadied itself, then continued, barreling itself down the hill; beware of unstoppable hopping amphibians travelling at speed.

It hadn’t rained yet today, which made the humidity just about bearable. And the cool flowing river, waterfall and pool at the end of the trail (or the midpoint), was gorgeously refreshing. The river flows over three rocky plateaus, the steepest forming a magnificent waterfall which can be reached by carefully creeping along the slippery wet rock.

The walk back, as per usual, was faster, and the steep paved road was both downhill and cooler. Back at park HQ a school was prepping for an overnight stay, noisy kids were running about and a mountain of bags was blocking a road. Our intrepid minibus driver was there to pick us up again, and before we’d had time to recover we were being whisked back to the hotel once again.

Our final night in Kuching was also a Friday, and the city had a pleasant weekend vibe; market stalls were setup along the riverside, couples and families were out for an evening walk, and bands played to passers by. One of those bands, who’d been playing all week, was particularly awful; teenagers trying to make it with guitars — this last time we couldn’t help but give them some money. Hopefully all that practice will help. We took nighttime photos, bought more layer cake and said our farewells to the city.

I wanted some traditional Sarawak style Laksa before [flying north to Kota Kinabalu](/2014/05/shangri-la-rasa-ria-borneo/ "Shangri-la Rasa Ria, Borneo"), so we returned to John Brooke’s on the waterfront for our last evening meal. Sat outside, with a view of the river and a bronze cat statue, we reminisced about our time here; this is the Asia we love. Over Chinese tea we shared a laksa and a tom yam soup, and watched kids try and wake up the bronze cats.

Kuching is a charming, wonderful place we would happily come back to. There’s so much to see and do, the people are lovely, the city is quiet, the food is delicious. A real Bornean delicacy.
