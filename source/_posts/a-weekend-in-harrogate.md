At 6pm I left work to meet Samantha at Kings Cross station for our train to Harrogate, via Leeds. Sam has a conference all week, so we chose to go up early and make a weekend of it, staying at the Ascot House Hotel and renting an underpowered Chevy for the weekend.

We arrived at 10ish, and after a short wait because we'd been pressing the wrong bell, were shown to our room. Number 10, it was smart, quaint and comfortable, with a skylight over the bed.

Up promptly at 8:30am, we went down for breakfast and dutifully had our full English with coffee, toast and orange juice. At 10:30 we picked up the car and headed north west towards Ripon, specifically to Fountains Abbey, a national trust day out.

With the last of our national trust wedding vouchers from Sam's aunt, we bought a yearlong membership and set about exploring the grounds. The bright sun made the grass glow green, the odd fluffy cloud dallying above us.

Fountains abbey is a huge, ruined 12th century monument, and a UNESCO world heritage site. It is enormous! The spire still survives, along with the main walls of the church. Gaping holes show where beautiful stained glass would have been. A stone altar partly stands, looking down the length of the ruin, it's a roofless cathedral with a grass carpet. Above us a murder of crows shouts and squabbles, fighting over sitting space on the spire. Their nests are buried into the alcoves of the ruin. A group of school kids on a guided tour pass by, dressed head to toe as traditional monks, it's a strange sight. We listen as their guide explains the lavatorium and how monks would bathe four times a year. Between all the walls we stopped and shifted to get interesting photos, waiting and hoping for the birds to swoop at the right time, but never quite getting the shot we wanted.

Beyond the ruin lies a water garden, where the natural river valley is sculpted into beautiful greens with statues and ducks, and fearless frogs that leap in front of you. Pheasants (not grouse), flicked up dead leaves searching for a tasty grub. We climbed the hillside to get the best viewpoints, from Anne Boleyn's shed and the more ornate temple. And we stopped for a picnic, I'd purchased some hobnobs, chocolate ones too.

Further along, past all the pretty lakes and ponds, we came to the end of the grounds and a small tea room. A perfect excuse for tea and carrot cake, while watching the crows dance about the outdoor tables.

Beyond the tended grounds the grass grew long and scattered with mole hills. We climbed up towards a nearby church before heading back round to the car. A full four hours of walking complete.

In the car we drove through the beautiful Yorkshire countryside to Ripon, stopping to peruse the local shops, grab a tasty homemade pork pie and explore the cathedral, complete with ancient crypt. We learnt the history of Ripon through knitted cushions adorning the church edge.

Back in Harrogate we set out for an evening meal. We discovered the Michelin recommended Orchid restaurant, serving a variety of Asian foods from Thailand, Korea, Hong Kong and Indonesia. Their cocktail menu was none too shabby. We sipped our alcoholic concoctions in smart leather seats, chop sticks poised and awaiting food.

Food is served in the middle of the table and everything is shared. It was all exquisite, and tasted authentic. It had that special something extra, that extra spice or freshness, something that made each dish standout from other Asian restaurants we'd been too. That difference that's so hard to find because Asian menus are so exotic.

We walked home, sated and exhausted. An amazing day all round.

Up early again, the dongs of the 8:45 iPhone alarm woke us from our slumber, our muscles slightly stiff from yesterday's walking. Altering our breakfast choices, Sam tried the kippers and I had scramble egg, before setting out to explore Harrogate. The weather took a turn for the worse and under the cover of umbrella we strolled into town and explored the parks, shops and art galleries.

An exhibition of Neil Simone's oil paintings was on show; an interesting gallery that alters perspective and creates pictures within pictures that blur the boundaries. I'd love to have bought one, but at £2,000 each I couldn't afford it. We nipped into Betty's tea rooms and gasped at the queue that went out and around the corner. It'd be even worse tomorrow, it being Mothering Sunday and all. But we were still full from breakfast and passed up the opportunity. Perusing the estate agents, we gasped at house prices and how much more your money could buy up north.

At the hotel we rested and snacked before driving west to Bolton Abbey, just inside the Yorkshire dales national park. Another ruined abbey to explore, but despite being left to ruin in the 16th century after the dissolution by Henry VIII, a functioning parish church still survives on the site. The spire and adorning buildings are long but gone, and daffodils grow up the sides of their eroding walls.

Beyond the Abbey is a river with stepping stones to cross. Kids, adults and ramblers brave the hop skip jump as the water flows through the gaps. For the less brave a wooden bridge is available to cross.

A trek took us up the side of the valley, with gorgeous views over the ruins and Yorkshire dales.  Legs still tired we took the shorter walk, and stopped to photograph the 'V' formations of geese flying overhead.

Growing hungry it was time to head to dinner; the piece de la resistance of our holiday and to celebrate our second wedding anniversary. We had a reservation at The Burlington, a coveted Michelin star restaurant, part of The Devonshire Arms hotel and surrounded by beautiful moorland. The car park was adorned with sports cars, and at the entrance were fishing rods and jackets for patrons. We were mildly intimidated.

We smartened and freshened up after our hike and were shown to the cocktail lounge, a 6:30pm reservation, for 7pm dining. In lounge chairs next to a roaring fireplace and Bolton Abbey oil paintings we ordered cocktails, a Kir Royale and a non-alcoholic Cinderella cocktail (Sam was driving). We opted for the ‘Menu Prestige’, a mere £85 each at just thirteen courses. Luckily they provided us with an extra canapé course beforehand.

</div>

At 7pm prompt, we were led into the main restaurant, a lavish pink walled affair with large, perfectly polished wooden tables, more oil paintings and a tower of wine glasses in the centre. Like clockwork we were guided to our seats and the waiters appeared from the wings to make us comfortable.

To start, some freshly baked, right out of the oven, bread and seaweed salted butter. We were delicate in our spreading, unbeknownst of the appropriate etiquette. Each course was an event in its own right. The mojito was a cocktail in food form, on a grapefruit jelly base. A black pewter bowl contained our onion velouté, two waiters lifted the lids in sync, and the gorgeous aroma left us salivating. Breaking the egg yolk, its yellow oozed deliciously.

With each course the waitress explained what we'd be eating. Salmon and crab, then veal done three ways, and a creamy rich foie gras. The next dish was scallops, and then a pallet cleansing Verjus with beetroot. Then the big event, our main course. The braised beef came covered in a large clear dome, and filled with steam. Again, at once, the lids were removed to reveal a gorgeous, scrumptious dish.

Near to us a mother and daughter had ordered the same, and were going through the menu at the same speed. At the back a family of five were dressed smartly, two young kids asking the adults intriguing questions from a box of cards: what's your favourite room in the house? (How big does your house need to be to play that?)

After a short break, and declining the cheese, our meal continued into dessert. A light coriander jelly pre-dessert, then a beautiful rhubarb dish with a quite fantastic champagne foam. Neither of us thought we liked rhubarb, but this was something else, even with its slight homage to rhubarb crumble. And finally the nutty chocolately dessert, with a tart lime sorbé. If that wasn't enough, we returned to the cocktail lounge to relax with coffee and petits fours, including a rather lovely fennel jelly. On the armchairs we sat, subdued and sated.

I settled the rather large bill and we set out into the night on our journey home, in the silver Chevy, through the thunderous rain and hail, over the dales, back to Harrogate.

Our final full day in Harrogate, we were up early again and I had another full English, though this time without the eggs. Sam had just the eggs, on toast. And we helped ourselves to the tea and coffee. We had another National Trust place on our list to visit. To the north west, beyond Ripon, lie Brimham Rocks. Here huge and peculiar formations of rock poke from the ground, perfect for climbing.

The sky was a dark blue, and scattered with fluffy white clouds. Some huge boulders looked precarious, as if one slight push would send them tumbling after thousands of years of erosion. Each interesting new tower invited us to climb it, scrambling into the nooks and crannies, jumping and pulling to get to the top, each peak afforded sweeping views of the Yorkshire dales.

The climbing abated when we stopped for tea and chocolate hobnobs. Excitingly for me, but probably not for many other people, I spotted a millipede, I've seen then many times before but never in England. Beyond the shop and tea stall a path takes you around the top-most peninsula. Past the dancing bear formation, around to the Druids writing desk, a huge twisted plinth leaning out over the edge. Then the amazing balancing rock, an enormous boulder precariously standing on the smallest point you can imagine.

We climbed another formation for glorious views to the north. Large black crows skipped about the rock next to us, and the sun was warm, cutting through the crisp spring air. The fields shone green, dotted with the occasional sheep.

Further round, now circling the tea room, the land turned to heath, and a pair of grouse were spotted fighting in the growth before spotting us and flying away. Atop another rock, we had just enough signal to make a phone call. It being Mothering Sunday, we called our mums, although it seems there was only enough signal for one call at a time, when Sam began her chat I would be consistently cut off. From here we could see Harrogate and the mysterious Menwith radomes at the US air base. We picnicked on the rocks and returned to the car. Before heading home we took a drive through the dales, through Pateley Bridge, Hebden and Grassington, down to Skipton and back to Harrogate.

The rest of the day was quiet, we relaxed, I watched football on the TV, we slept and then went for dinner at the hotel restaurant. A hearty tasty meal to end the trip.

On Monday I wheeled my suitcase to Harrogate station and headed into work on the train, three hours through the rolling green of East Anglia with all its power stations. Sam stayed in town for her conference, which lasted until Thursday, she changed hotels and had time to properly visit Betty's for tea and cake.
