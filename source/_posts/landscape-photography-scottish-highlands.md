On a Friday night, the weekend before my 30th birthday, Samantha sat down with me after work and told me that we’d be going away this coming weekend. She was treating me to a long weekend away in the snowy and picturesque Scottish highlands, where we’d spend our time amidst mountains and lochs learning landscape photography, and a spend a little time tasting extravagant food too. She’d already informed people at work that I’d be away (and that they should try to avoid arranging meetings with me on Monday and Tuesday). Her card read:

We took a midday EasyJet flight from Gatwick Airport to Inverness. While we waited for the flight, which was a little delayed (and we were nervous it’d be cancelled because of snow – there’d been travel problems all week in Scotland because of snow drifts), we enjoyed a cooked breakfast at the airport’s Comptoir Libanais restaurant; [just as we had done for my birthday when in London, 2013](/2013/02/birthday-surprise/2/). Soon we were in the air and flying North, over England’s clear skies, into Scotland, over the Cairngorms where the mountaintops looked beautiful after a fresh covering of snow, and down into Inverness, on the North coast, where I happened to see a pod of whales beneath the water. As flights go, that was good one. At the airport we hopped on the half-hour bus to Inverness town centre. It was colder, but not too cold. That didn’t stop us from dropping into a camping shop on route to our hotel to pick up a couple of warm things.

## The Glenmoriston Town House

Our hotel was nestled alongside the River Ness; you might guess what loch feeds that river. From town we walked along the frozen snow laden path with our luggage to [The Glenmoriston Town House](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186543-d191380-r250811328-Glenmoriston_Town_House-Inverness_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html); Kate the friendly receptionist checked us in – she was in on the secret, and was unsure how much I already knew, she coyly played it safe. Our ground floor room was spacious and comfortable, though it was cold – the _stone cold_ bathroom tiles necessitated a path of towels on the floor to avoid coldly hopping about like a mad man.

With a bit of time to spare (before the early sunset) we explored a little of Inverness town centre; walking along the river, then up to [Inverness Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness_Castle) (now a court room) – only the castle grounds are open to the public. From the castle you can see right the way West, towards the mountains, where the sun was casting a reddish light. We continued along the river a bit further, then double backed to the hotel for a hot chocolate and a rest before dinner.

## Abstract

One of Sam’s main reasons for picking this hotel was its incredible food. Its brasserie, _Contrast_ was outstanding, but it also had a high-end restaurant _Abstract_, where we’d choose to have their 7 course tasting menu. After cocktails in the bar we were seated, on Sam’s request, at their best table, a table for two with private mood lighting by a window looking out at the river through classy venetian blinds. The walls and furniture were made of a dark wood, and abstract black paintings hung on the wall, Gregory Porter music gave the restaurant a classy and smooth jazz ambiance.

{% menu %}
* Canapés
* ‘Dark and Stormy’, cured wild salmon, ginger, whisky and soy
* Samantha: Gairloch Crab Ravioli; native brown crab, saffron pasta, bisque puree, heritage tomato
* Paul: Roast Saddle of Venison; beetroot, pickled red cabbage, caramelised walnuts
* Chef’s haggis; Ross-shire lamb, sweet breads, black pepper and neep
* Devenick rose Veal; Slow cooked Aberdeenshire fillet, smoked potato, hops and oyster
* Cheese plate; quince jelly, crackers and grape chutney
* Strawberries and cream; strawberry carpaccio, basil, soft meringue and iced clotted cream

I chose the venison, and Sam had the crab, but otherwise our meals were identical. The venison was my highlight – the strong meat flavour combined excellently with sweetened walnuts, cabbage and beetroot; I savoured every bite. The simple cured salmon with a touch of whisky and ginger was also divine.

Feeling loved, and full up on all that food (plus some lovely bread which they kept bringing), it was time to sleep; tomorrow [our two day photography adventure would begin](/2015/01/landscape-photography-scottish-highlands/2/).
