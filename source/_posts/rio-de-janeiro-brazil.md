We felt unprepared for Brazil, we booked the flights and the first week of hotels but left the second week open for whatever we pleased. The holiday sneaked up on us whilst we were busy working, and suddenly we were on the plane from Heathrow, stopping at Paris for some Camembert and an excellent nighttime view of the Eiffel tower, then onwards, to Rio, via an 11 hour Air France flight with complimentary champagne.

In Rio we arrived to a broken baggage carousel, overcast skies and rush hour traffic. Along Linha Vermelha we drove, Rio’s steep mountains in the distance, tops covered in cloud, a shanty town favela to our right; rickety buildings piled on one another with corrugated iron rooftops and thin dirt roads dividing them. Above us great black vultures circled and on either side motorbikes honked as they weaved passed.

It took an hour or so to make it to Botafogo and our hotel, O Veleiro B&B, atop a twisting cobbled street. It was a beautiful three storey yellow building set amongst a small tropical garden, pool and bar area. Marmosets climb down from the trees to eat bananas, hummingbirds flit about, and a tortoise plods by, always on the look out for someone’s tasty toes.

Inside a dark wooden staircase takes you up to the living room and communal dining area where we checked in. Our room was simple with wooden shutter doors, a double bed, sink, some mosquito spray and an outdoor shared toilet and shower next to some hammocks.

Hoteliers Rob and Rich showed us around and pointed out the sights, Botafogo below us, the head of Christ the Redeemer to the right, and sugarloaf hiding behind the trees. All checked-in and ready to go, we set off to explore Rio for the first time, very aware of our belongings and security.

Rich showed us a shortcut down through the winding roads, a steep narrow alleyway into town, then a 20 minute walk to the metro station. Each tower block had security gates and tall metal railings. Inside guards watched CCTV cameras.

Tourists are advised to use taxis but the metro is very safe, and simple too. R$3 per journey, we loaded up a prepay card and took the orange line to Ipanema. The Sunday ‘hippy’ market was on in the square; homemade jewellery, t-shirts and the usual market thoroughfare amongst stunning artwork portraying favelas, the people and the sights.

There was a sunny haze about the beach. Huge waves crashed against the shore amongst perfect bodied volleyballers, skaters, swimmers and sunbathers. Military personnel stood around in shorts and t-shirt, their guns holstered but hanging out for all to see. The sand was fine and warm between our toes.

Every 200m or so you can find a corn on the cob stand, which we had to try. We nipped into town looking for food. At Polis Sucos we ordered freshly made juice, but guessed from the foreign menu, I remembered maracuja was passion fruit, the other juice was pink, and probably raspberry and something, but I can’t be sure.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-004.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-004.jpg)

We came out next to Ipanema lagoon. Across the water was Christ the Redeemer. Joggers and cyclists ran by, many on Rio’s orange Boris bikes. Desperate for some food, we sat down at the fluorescent orange Koni, a trendy new restaurant chain, for some brazilian-japanese sushi fusion.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-005.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-005.jpg)

Koni’s specialty is based on a ‘cone’ of rice wrapped in seaweed. You choose your filling, which is usually tempura. The honey roast tuna, shimeji tempura and salmon tempura were all yummy. We washed it all down with some iced tea.

Exhausted from travelling and walking we headed home, via a market for dessert and snacks. Back at the hotel we shoved in our ear plugs, turned on the overhead fan and fell fast asleep. The sounds of german conversation outside fading into our dreams.

<!--nextpage-->

We woke afresh at 7:45 the next morning, no jet lag and a good twelve hours of sleep. At the communal breakfast table we ate toast, coffee and cake whilst roaring planes flew low overhead. Outside a hummingbird looked for food.

It was still overcast but the clouds were high enough not to impede views. We gambled and decided to spend the day at Christo do Redentor. With directions from Rich we walked  down into Laranjeiras around to Corcovado train station, where tourists can get a red cog train up the hill to the foot of the famous statue.

The next train was two hours away! Ah well, we bought our tickets and avoided the ticket pedalling taxi drivers at the entrance. Now, how to occupy ourselves while we wait? This area of town is mostly residential.

Further up the hill was Largo do Boticario, a colourful but dilapidated 19th century mansion. Moss grew thick on sky blue walls, window shutters were broken, and the grand wooden doors had seen better days.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-006.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-006.jpg)

The whole time we stayed in Rio there was an ongoing fear about protecting our valuables; not making the SLR camera too obvious, etc. In this secluded place we first felt comfortable enough to get some snaps.

On the way up we passed a gang of shady looking guys. One down the road appeared to be a spotter, he’d gesture to the group, and they’d start their routine. One guy came out into the road, pretending to direct a bus as it turned, another tried to divert a car away from the turning bus but up a very steep hill that led to a favela. We didn’t see anyone fall for the scam, but who knows what would happen if a tourist in a rental had taken the bait.

With still an hour to go we explored the nearby church, a grand circular building with beautiful stained glass. It was rest-bite from the touristness going on outside, where coaches were reversing, horns honking and traffic was heavy. With a few minutes to go, we grabbed lunch from a grocers.

Beneath rows of flags, in the station, we boarded the two carriage cog train. Sitting on the right, facing down the hill gives the best views. The train set-off, chugging up the hill, gradually climbing to the summit. It took about half an hour, the trees occasionally subsiding to reveal views of Rio and its beaches below.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-027.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-027.jpg)

At the top, up some steps and there he is, Christ the Redeemer, arms outstretched in all his glory. The viewing platform is rammed with people, many crouching to the floor to get the tight angled photo of the statue, others spreading their arms out wide in the familiar pose. Around the edges people jostled for the best views.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brasil-006.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brasil-006.jpg)

Below us Rio looked magnificent. We took all the photos we could imagine, and then some more. Down over Ipanema, and views of the lagoon, where a helicopter landed on the large yellow H. Then out towards Botafogo and the sugarloaf, cable cars going up and down, with Niteroi just visible out across the sea. Favelas everywhere, towers of rickety shacks popping up on the hills and between tower blocks. Rain lashed down and we wiped the lens clean.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brasil-003.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brasil-003.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-023.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-023.jpg)

Of course the pictures rarely give the view justice. You can’t capture the dizzying wind, the sounds of birds in the forest, or that vertiginous feeling of looking over the edge.

Then for 30 minutes in the entire day the sun returned, the views cleared and on a quiet bench behind the redeemer we shared our picnic lunch before heading back down.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-026.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-026.jpg)

Sam had the camera on the route down, and she probably snapped a few hundred images of blurry trees. And then we walked home again, back through Laranjeiras, stopping once for a delicious cinnamon cappuccino amongst the half decorated Christmas trees.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-030.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-030.jpg)

Back at the hotel we relaxed on the hammocks, read our guide and played with the tortoise, unwilling to test whether he really did eat toes. Four new guys arrived, also from London, and we shared our stories so far. They’d just flown in from Sao Paulo. They weren’t sure whether to stay, the place seemed to far ‘away from the action’, but we sung its praises and they warmed to it.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-031.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-031.jpg)

For dinner we booked a ‘top-rated’ Bahian restaurant in Copacabana, “Siri Mole & Cia”. It was rush hour so we walked down to the metro in the dark, traipsing through the wet streets with an umbrella. From Ipanema we found our place, the menu looked pricey, but we’d booked and there’s no way we were hunting around for somewhere else. It looked busy for a Monday night.

Positive reviews adorned the walls, and our Lonely Planet’s description sold it to us. We were looking forward to trying traditional Bahian cuisine which has African roots. The moqueca and vatapa were recommended. I ordered a manioc flour and prawn vatapa, and  Sam had the ‘fish’ moqueca, along with the optional couvert. We erred on the side of caution, the prices really were astronomical, but we expected the finest cuisine.

We should have noticed something when the couvert was merely tuna mayo on stale bread, but we gave them the benefit of the doubt. When our meals did arrive Sam’s was average but mine was downright horrible, a yucky orange sludge that lacked any flavour or seasoning. We were aggrieved to even pay for it, but at Michelin star prices, and with such fabulous reviews, we felt conned. We cannot possibly fathom how such an atrocious place reached such accolade. It had the feel and taste of a restaurant that begs for business with a tout. We blindly assumed price was proportional to quality.

We left quickly and got a taxi home. Alas, we were put off trying any other Bahian cuisine. I put earplugs in and mistakenly fell asleep on top of the covers, a perfect feast for the mosquitoes in waiting. Don’t sleep on top of the covers. Spray and protect.

It was overcast again on Tuesday.

The guys were at breakfast, and they’d had a drunken late night in Ipanema and weren’t feeling so hot. After coffee and toast we headed out for the sugarloaf.

We walked down through Botafogo, along the white stony paths, past the guards and railings, a shopping centre and along Praia do Botafogo. It was a national holiday and the joggers were out in force. We continued past the university and into Urca.

Urca is a small village-like retreat within Rio. Sitting tightly beneath the sugarloaf, it juts out into the sea, and there are just a few rows of houses. But the signs of Rio are gone, no taxis, no security or graffiti, just Christ the Redeemer standing tall in the distance, amidst a beautiful view of the city and well tended gardens.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brasil-014.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brasil-014.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brasil-016.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brasil-016.jpg)

A sea wall and promenade surrounds Urca, and we followed it round. Joggers and their dogs ran by, fishermen sat with their lines cast into the sea, a cheeky heron hanging around nearby waiting to grab their catch. Kids played on the beach and the area had a lovely small-community feel to it.

At the end of the promenade, where we could walk no further, there is a busy bar, appropriately named “Bar Urca”. We bought hot snacks; fish balls, mini samosas and pasties and joined everyone drinking and eating on the sea wall.

We were casually looking for a restaurant, and found it by accident after eating our snacks.   Garota da Urca was hugely popular with the locals, and on this national holiday it was heaving with families, all having the same thing: thin steak cooked on a hot plate, served with farofa, chips, salad and rice. We pointed, “we’ll have one of those”, and still hungry we gorged ourselves on tasty steak and carbs. Delicious, even if it did induce a food coma.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-036.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-036.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-035.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-035.jpg)

Sated, rested and ready for the rest of the day we headed out of Urca, round past the cable car entrances, along the small Praia Vermelha, past a performing amateur drama group, and onto a 2km walking nature trail, Pista Claudio Coutinho.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-038.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-038.jpg)

The trail arches around the southern side of Päo de Açúar (suagarloaf). In wooded surroundings, the great rock towered to our left while waves crashed against it’s foot to the right. The quiet route had the occasional jogger, family or climber. On large wooden boards the types of wildlife were listed, but only in Portuguese. Bright red birds flitted between the leaves and tame marmosets climbed down to say hello, clearly expecting to be fed something. Large black vultures sat in the trees above us, and a father was teaching his son to boulder.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-044.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-044.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-046.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-046.jpg)

We walked out, to the large pillar and the end of the trail, then back again, and to the cable cars. Sam swallowed her fear of rooms that dangle in mid-air, and we climbed aboard. The large modern car took us up 220m to Morro da Urca.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-049.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-049.jpg)

Atop we passed the helipad and restaurant, and started snapping photos of the incredible Rio views. Tower blocks rise from greenery, and nestle into every possible corner, gradually rising up the mountainside. The clouds fly beneath Christo Redentor, through the valleys, and misty hilltops poke out above them. We are already high above Botafogo and Urca. This ‘level’ also has a museum, showing how the cable cars were built, and with a scary example of the first one.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-051.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-051.jpg)

Then upwards again, onto the second cable car to take us to Päo de Açúar, 396m above Rio. Wow, the views are incredible. From here you can see Botafogo, Centro, Copacabana, Ipanema poking from behind a rock, Flamengo and beyond to Sao Cristovao and out across the sea to Niteroi.

We took photos at every angle, explored the shops and walkways, and watched other tourists pose for their own shots. It was quiet and lovely.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-063.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-063.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-061.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-061.jpg)

Sam bought us Caipirinhas and we sat to take in the scenery, waiting for the sun to set. Rays of sunlight peaked through the clouds, occasionally dazzling us in sunshine. A light breeze kept us cool. Black herons swarmed high above us and marmosets hopped around the white railings, scavenging for food. Our Brazil Lonely Planet book sat rested on the table, well thumbed and scribbled on. Rio life continuing beneath us.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-066.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-066.jpg)

We watched as aeroplanes lifted from their runway, climbing and circling above the water, where ships were heading to the docks. The quiet whirring sounds of cable cars going up and down were met with idle Brazilian chit-chat. It was peaceful, tranquil and beautiful. We could see everything. There was no rush to do anything, nothing to worry about, only the city, the hills, the sea and the wildlife.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-070.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-070.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-071.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-071.jpg)

The sky began to darken, and the city lights turned on, one by one, through twilight into night. We positioned our tripod and took sweeping photos of the cityscape, Christ the Redeemer now basking in white light. After a couple of shots we noticed him disappear behind a thick cloud.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-074.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-074.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-075.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-075.jpg)

Then the cloud moved closer, covering Rio beneath us, lit up from below. The winds picked up and then it was too late to go anywhere; swirling winds and lashing rain hit the sugarloaf, we were inside the storm cloud and dashed for cover.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-078.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-078.jpg)

At the cable car station we all sheltered from the 100kmph winds. The cable car closed and we were stranded until it passed, if it passed. In our wet weather gear we befriended the other tourists, and I ventured outside a couple of times. The wind pushed me down and rain soaked my face, as I clambered high above the city lights.

After 40 minutes the rain stopped and the cable car re-opened, the winds still bashing us. Apparently the cable car could withstand it. We filled the car and began our dark descent, the car swinging in the wind, everyone screaming with each sudden movement. The darkness masked most of the fear, it was easy to forget how high up we were. But after this Sam should be able to face any cable car ride. At Morro da Urca we charged through and did the same again, taking the second car back down to sea level.

And the adventure was over and we were starving. Miam Miam, a recommended restaurant, looked like it was nearby and we walked in search of it. In hindsight we should have got a taxi. Wandering the empty dark streets, even in this relatively safe area, felt risky. After 20 minutes or so we found a shopping centre and asked for directions. “It’s just around that corner. But take a taxi”, “It’s nearby but you should go by taxi”.

We didn’t take a taxi, but we didn’t continue our search either. Inside, next to the upmarket shops were food places and we found a fantastic pizzeria. No English menus but we could guess, no English speaking waiters, but we could gesture. In Brazil everyone eats pizza with a knife and fork, I complied. In the large red lit chain restaurant we waited for our stone-baked pizza and happily devoured our tasty carbs when they arrived.

Taxi home, and sleep, out like a light.

On our third full day in Rio it rained, not a slight drizzle or the occasional shower, a constant downpour all day. Luckily by now we’d done the two major Rio landmarks and didn’t have to rush about town ticking off our sightseeing checkboxes. Instead we lazily headed up to the dining room table for breakfast with our new friends.

Eating home made cake, spreading butter on toast and trying the latest fruit juice, we discussed our day plans with the four guys from London and Cookie, who now had a day to herself after her friend had flown back to England. We tried to convince the others to come with Rob and us on a day trip to Rio’s national park and parts of the city that tourists rarely see. Everyone cautiously agreed, but it never happened, and quite rightly given the rain outside. A hidden deserted beach isn’t so wonderful in the wet.

From the dining room in O Veleiro’s bed and breakfast we looked out across Botafogo, today you couldn’t even see Christ the Redeemer, he was quite literally up in the clouds. We hung around on the hammocks by our room, reading the Lonely Planet and planning the next stage of our journey, keeping an eye out for hummingbirds that occasionally fly down and hover around the flowers.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-079.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-079.jpg)

Around lunch time we were getting peckish. The weather looked like it was clearing up, so we gambled and headed out into town, with a hopeful plan of walking around the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas. Down the winding road from the B&B, left at a hidden alleyway and down the shortcut steps, into Botafogo and on to the metro. We topped up our cards for one last set of journeys and hopped onto the orange metro line, on the air conditioned train, along to Ipanema.

Up the stairs and escalators and back into the open world, the rain was falling harder than ever. We were wearing wet weather gear and must have looked ridiculous. We tried walking through Ipanema towards Zuka, a recommended restaurant, but we soon gave up and jumped in a taxi. After a bit of floundering, some gesticulating at a map (which didn’t help because the driver didn’t have his reading glasses), we made it into Leblon and found the place we were after.

Sopping wet, in shorts and black plastic, we walked into the suave Zuka, water dripping everywhere. Flustered, we sat near the entrance and perused the menu, but not before Sam had knocked over her warm hot couvert. We really hoped the posh looking carioca business folks didn’t mind us too much.

This really felt upmarket; in Rio, where you’re cautious of your valuables at all times, and where imported products cost an arm and leg due to import tax, diners had their iPhones, laptops and iPads out for all to see. It could well have been London at lunch time. It was odd to see this lavishness, knowing that just a few blocks away was a favela.

The food was incredible and, at last, good value. Served on oblong stone plates, there was care and attention to flavours, sauces and presentation, something that proved to be a rarity in brazilian dining. This turned out to be the best place we ate in Brazil, it’s a shame we only had lunch here. But we made the most of it, with a starter, main and ‘sombremesa’ (desserts), and a strong espresso coffee to finish.

A taxi home at Rio rush hour, back to the B&B where everyone was still lounging around, reading their books, browsing the internet or using their phones. It was very much a day of doing nothing. In light of this the guys decided we should all go out to a live samba night in Lapa, at the centre of Rio’s bohemian scene amongst all the dilapidated old mansions and the tram line that no longer runs.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/IMG_3600.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/IMG_3600.JPG)

At 7ish Richard made us all Caipirinhas and the eight of us went by two taxis to Carioca da Gema. R$ 20 for the music, and the place was packed. We found a table upstairs overlooking the stage where we ordered beer and shared nibbles, I can’t remember any of the portuguese names of things, just that the little bean samosas were lovely.

(A brazilian peculiarity, at pubs, bars and even service stations, when you enter you’re given a card with menu items on. As you buy things the items are ticked off on the card, and you pay on your way out.)

At eight o’clock Bruna Baffa took the stage, and we knew the crowd already loved them. We moseyed down and tried our feet at samba, amongst the dancing veterans and the cool, beautiful cariocas.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mo8vty09rw8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="margin: 0 auto"></iframe>

Later that evening a more nuanced improvised samba act took the stage, Alaan Monteiro with Wanderlkey Monteiro, who seemed to be a local celebrity, well, his picture was on all sorts of t-shirts and CDs. The bar was quieter, but that just meant there was more space to  dance; and some of the best showed us how to do it.

A perfect way to end our time in Rio.

O Veleiro really felt like a home in Rio, and it helped us make the best of the city whilst it rained. The breakfast table helped us chat with other travellers, see where they’d been, find out where they were going, tell our stories and talk about our plans. It felt like a wonderful close knit group, and was exactly what we were looking for.

Packed and ready to go, we said our goodbyes the next morning and taxi’d (because you go everywhere in Rio by taxi) to the international airport. We’d booked our flight and Igaucu hotel beforehand, but we hadn’t planned the return leg at all. So after check-in we frantically ran around the Gol, TAM and Webjet desks to get flight quotes from anyone that spoke a little bit of English.
