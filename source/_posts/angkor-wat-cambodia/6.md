## Goodbye Cambodia

The final day of our three week holiday, it went slowly, it has felt like an eternity, but I can't help but want more.

We said our goodbyes to all the wonderful staff at Pavillon D'Orient and took a car to the small but lovely Siem Reap airport. We flew Cambodia Angkor Air to [Ho Chi Minh city (Saigon)](/2012/12/a-day-in-saigon-vietnam/). A total of 15 people were on the flight, including crew and pilot, and the plane had propellors. The small, old plane felt that little bit less safe, as it jigged and jumped amongst the strong winds and turbulence. The trip wasn't without its moments of fear for Sam, and she regularly gripped my hand. I pointed out she should only be afraid if the crew members look panicked. We flew over Tonle Sap and spotted floating villages on the riverbanks, and planned our Saigon itinerary, we'd have about six hours.
