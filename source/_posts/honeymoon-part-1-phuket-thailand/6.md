## Indigo Pearl feast

Easter Sunday was a day of rest and the big Indigo Pearl rose brunch. Free flowing sparkling rose was just the tip of the iceberg.

There was fine cheese and cured ham; thirty types of sushi, takoyaki (Japanese dumplings with octopus), sashimi picked from the fish--including a great big Tuna; lobster, mantis shrimp, oysters and crab; miniature dishes of beef and asparagus, squid, roasted butternut squash, feta cheese, mixed seafood and others; a barbecue where you choose what you’d like cooked, including three types of steak, lamb chop, sausage, corn on the cob, salmon, squid, king prawns and fish of the day; indian curry selection; vegetable and roast selection; a hog roast with mustard and dressings; roasted lamb ribs; hoisin duck and anything you wanted stir fried or curried; complimentary starters from the chef; desserts of all varieties, 15 flavours of ice cream, cheesecake, chocolate cake, easter egg; waffles and pancakes freshly made; fresh fruit including mango and dragon fruit, thick smoothies, chocolate pots; and tea and coffee.

It was all presented on magnificent ice sculptures of swans and elephants, with extremely attentive, friendly and helpful staff - always with a smile on their face, even carrying your food laden plate back to the table for you.

Whilst our bellies got over their fullness (Sam must have eaten enough for a week!), we relaxed to the live music with a view of the pool, covers of Lady Gaga to Dire Straits wafted by as we sat in slumber, occasionally applauding the band for their excellent renditions.

A slow walk back to the beach, sand in our toes, water occasionally hitting them. We chilled out by the pool, ordered a light evening meal at the bar (Sam’s seafood salad was hilariously huge), and chillaxed.

The night time pool dip lead to some mosquito bites, inevitable really.
