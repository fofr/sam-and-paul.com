## Adamas hotel

Day 3, Thursday, and it was the end of our brief but wonderful spell at Indigo Pearl. Breakfast, beach walk and a dip in the pool and we were off, using their concierge to book a rental car and drive to Adamas, just down the coast.

Adamas looks out across the Nai Yang bay, a beautiful sea vista greets you when you check-in, and it’s all very serene. Our room was on the second floor and it offered another stunning view. The bed could have slept four, it was so big, and the bathroom had the same intriguing partition as Pearl’s. Rose petals and two love birds made from towels were on the bed. The swimming pool swept around the resort, with a central garden and an infinity ledge looking out at the sea. Small turtles formed steps into it, from pool side rooms.

## Driving in Phuket

The car rental was a Toyota Yaris, and I had to get used to driving an automatic. Phuket’s roads are well laid, and easy to drive. The difficult bit comes in dealing with the peculiar actions of other drivers and copious mopeds and bikes - often with 2 or 3 (or even a dog) riding along. Bikes with side cars would swerve out, without indication, and trucks carrying 20 people on the back would undertake if you weren’t breaking the speed limits. Down the unnecessarily winding road with hidden speed bumps, we arrived at Adamas, with a small sigh of relief.

We chilled out in the lounge with a cocktail served in a pineapple, being sure to cover ourselves with anti-bug spray beforehand. After a spot of snooker, we had food at the bar, a tasty pad thai served in an egg net with prawns and ground nuts and Salmon with garlic and black pepper.
