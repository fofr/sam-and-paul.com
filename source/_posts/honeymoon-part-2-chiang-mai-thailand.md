Part one of our holiday was over, we checked out, returned the rental and took an Air Asia flight north, to Chiang Mai.

With a complimentary airport transfer we arrived at Rimping Village, our next port of call. Unlike the previous resorts, this was a small, personal and homely place -- all rooms overlook the pool, and the grounds are dominated by a grand Banyan tree. We traded in luxury for warmth, friendliness and new friends. We loved it, the guests and the staff.

Settled in, we headed out to explore the hot hot dusty hazy Chiang Mai. Without a sea breeze, the 40C+ temperatures were exhausting to walk in (even at night it was 33C), and mid-afternoon probably wasn’t the best time to start.

Crossing the Nawara bridge, we took up a tuk-tuk driver’s offer to show us the city and find us some food (obviously we bartered the price down). Chiang Mai was going to be a very different type of holiday, there was activity everywhere; markets, street food on every corner, monks, motorcycles, travel savvy tourists mingling with the locals, temples down every road, the dust never has a chance to settle.

We ate pad thai and noodles at a small local place, for less that 100B total (about £2), and took a whistle-stop tour around the city.

Overcome with the head, we recovered by the salt water pool and air conditioned room. In the (slightly) less hot evening, we walked along the river to eat at the Riverview bar, a place popular with everyone, it was heaving with life and live music greeted you at the entrance. Time to try the local beer, Chang, a standard lager, but not too bad. With a platter of North Thai hors d'oeuvres, including pork scratchings, and VERY spicy chilli dip, we enjoyed the atmosphere and relaxed.

Day 2 and it was time to explore. We took a tuk-tuk to the centre of the old town and started a walking tour of the “Wats” (temples). Leaving early to avoid the heat, we covered Wat Phra Singh, Wat Chedi Luang, Wat Phan Tao and Wat Chiang Man. Monks cleaned the courtyards or just bandied together as a group of lads. Each temple had a different characters and we watched as people came and bowed to Buddha images, burnt incense or left donations. One monk was receiving a massage, others gave lessons or spread water over those bowed, as a blessing of sorts. Lotus and orchids decorated the statues.

Outside you could pay to release birds from cages, “pay to free them”, and they’ll go and catch more with a cash incentive. They wouldn’t let me take their picture.

The 40C heat left us sweaty and desperate for chilled drinks, we ran the gauntlet of tuk-tuks, mopeds and trucks to get to “Chocolate Fact”, an air-conditioned cafeteria that makes an excellent Mango Frappe. Relaxing on the leather sofas, we waited until we were almost cool enough to have goose-pimples, before stepping out into the sauna.

At the Chiang Mai city arts and cultural centre our legs couldn’t take a museum wander, we instead watched a bus load of formally dressed Thai women place flowers at the three kings monument before posing for photos. They couldn’t wear heels on the monument’s steps, and it was amusing watching them unstrap their six inch heels. They were part of Miss Songkran 2010, each was thin and unnaturally pale (there’s a strange culture of skin whitening products), but all very dignified.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-150.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-150.jpg)

A quick nip around the corner and we had our cheapest meal of the holiday. Two cokes, chicken and rice, pork satays, chilli dip and a very tasty peanut sauce. All for the pricey 85B, or about £1.50\. 

A tuk-tuk home, a dip in the pool and some fruit shakes (our favourites, Mango and Watermelon--SO refreshing!) returned us to normal. After eating by the pool, and yet more rice, we collapsed in our hotel bed, air-con struggling to hit 22C.

After such exhausting activities, I took a two hour nap whilst Sam went for a Thai massage, which sounded very painful--with masseurs channelling their weight through elbows into Sam’s back. Sam described the experience as “forceful”.

At 8ish we ventured out to the nearby Chiang Mai night bazaar (Amusa), a market selling hand made silks, wooden elephant carvings, bags, clothes, purses, mango wood vases, lanterns, Buddha images, dried fruits, condiments, freshly made fruit shakes and the usual market thoroughfare. 

At every stall you have to barter for a decent price. We found that starting at less than half their original price gave good results. If they accept your offer quickly you’re probably paying way too much. They also liked the hard sell technique, pulling out their calculators and offering a discount price before you’d decided you wanted it.

As per usual Sam spent an age comparing products, “this bed runner or that one? Do we want a table runner? Which vase should we get?”, and so on. 

At the centre is a large seafood section, with lobsters, shrimps etc. out on display, on beds of rapidly melting ice, which formed waterfalls to the floor. Around 10ish we realised how hungry we were, so stopped at the last of the still open street vendors to try a northern Thai specialty, Khao Soy. The cheap plastic plates and cutlery that had questionable cleanliness didn’t detract from the excellent taste.

The heat really was overwhelming, a dry heat, no wind and a constant haze over the city that made the sky look white. It seems the haze also blocked the UV, because despite the strong sun we didn’t burn. To get a bit more accustomed to it all we spent a day by the pool.

Swimming, playing with the inflatables, drinking fruit shakes, planning our week and talking with other guests about their adventures and plans; that formed the majority of the day. Sam talked about her new-found snorkelling skills (and troubles), to some divers, learnt a lot about elephants and mahouts and heard about a good but heavy going cooking school.

That night we booked a Lanna experience, food, traditional dance and a hotel pick-up, sounded great. At the complex we passed vegetable carvers and were seated next to a large stage. Almost immediately our food arrived, northern hors d’oeuvres with free refills, tasty and good value for our baht. Whilst we were eating the show began, a poor PA system got a bit confused and we had two audio streams for a while, but that sorted itself out. The Thai Lanna dancers performed finger-nail dances, knife dances, traditional battle dances and so on, though all of it felt overtly kitschy, and at a pretty poor standard. The slightly cheesy narration didn’t help. Our evening was saved by Sam going on stage and attempting to reproduce the complicated hand movements, a moment I’ve captured on video.

Friday took us to the Chiang Mai Thai cooking school, for an introduction to Thai ingredients and the preparation of six dishes. From our 9am hotel pick-up we travelled out to the country for our class. We each had a cooking station with gas burner, chopping board, knife, wok, bin and bowls of ingredients. In the kitchen we learnt about each dish, hear how to prepare the ingredients, watch the dish being cooked and return to have a go of our own, with help as required. 

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-166.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-166.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-163.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-163.jpg)

Spicy and sour soup kicked it off, with kaffir lime leaves, ginza and small green chillis (we had to guess at how spicy we wanted it). There was also lemongrass, but that tastes disgusting. It only took about 10 mins to prepare and we went away to eat it once done.

I briefly lost the taste/use of my tongue as I chomped through a very small, VERY spicy green chilli. My scoble scale has shifted as a result, and it seems nothing else tastes spicy.

Next up was fish cakes, with fish sauce, and a selection of bicarbonate soda, chilli sauce, palm sugar, etc, which we deep fried.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-17.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-17.jpg)

For our main course we created a green chicken curry, with a small and large egg plant and more kaffir lime leaves. Again we chose how spicy to make it. Accompanying the curry was the dish I most wanted to learn, pad thai; noodles, egg, various sauces for flavouring, dried shrimps, garlic and tofu. I loved making this, it was easy and delicious (and I did it better than Sam).

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-19.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-19.jpg)

In the afternoon, all a little stuffed from eating so much, we cooked water chestnuts in coconut milk and a minced chicken dish.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-23.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-23.jpg)

About 20 of us took the course, and over the day we got to know most of them, especially over food; a nice Australian couple on their honeymoon after a three day hindu wedding, a Brazilian that works in London that will now be in Laos or beyond, an English ex-pat and friend, up from Bangkok. There was a lot of bonding and it was sad to say bye at the end of the day.

A little bit tired of Thai food, and especially rice, we went to the upmarket Favola for dinner. Pizza, bread and wine was a refreshing break from the norm, even if it did cost a premium.  Away form the hustle and bustle of Chiang Mai, the restaurant in a hotel, could have been anywhere in the world.

<!--nextpage-->

On Saturday we were up early. Poached eggs on bread for breakfast again (we realised we were eating way too much egg, and it was having side effects), with coffee and the weird milk, croissants, and even spicy stir fry if you wanted it.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-233.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-233.jpg)

An air-con taxi picked us up as we travelled west, to Doi Suthep, and the King’s winter palace up on the mountain. Our driver was Mr Swing and that is what he did on the winding roads up the mountain.

In winter there’s normally an astonishing view across the city, the haze meant we could just about see there was a city there, but not much else.

We went to the palace first, “Phra tamnak phu phing”, where my shorts weren’t suiting and I had to don a pair 3/4 lengths over the top, nicely striped in red and white. The gardens specialised in cool weather flowers, most of which we were quite used to and not overly interested in. Most paths had “do not enter” signs all over them and the water fountain show was devoid of water.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-172.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-172.jpg)

Down the mountain a bit, we went to the hill side temple, Doi Suthep, complete with covered cable car to take you to the top. This temple felt more like a tourist trap, photo touts covered the temple grounds, flower offerings were on sale - 10B to place them on a shrine, only to have them picked up and sold to another customer 5 mins later. The entrance was strewn with market stalls and groups of children performing traditional dance.

We walked around the chedi, clockwise as we were meant to, and headed back. Before leaving altogether, we stopped at a Jade factory recommended by our driver. Quite clearly a front for people trying to sell expensive jade jewellery, we watched their video, had their free drinks and promptly left. I’m sure our driver would have received commission.

Not the greatest trip in the world, we enjoyed being back by the pool for the afternoon. We nipped out to the local flower market (talat tonlamyai) a bit later, to see vendors selling gorgeous lotus plants, orchids, roses and cooler flowers brought down from the mountains, jasmine necklaces for 5B each (oh how we love that smell), and even fake orchids which greatly pleased Sam. 

Inside the little road shacks people worked hard on complicated flower arrangements, huge wreaths and structures cleverly using banana leaves.

That evening we ate at the lovely looking “Whole Earth restaurant”, a thai-indian place with red parasols and a large wooden building at the centre, with outdoor balcony seating. Take off your shoes before entering.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-191.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-191.jpg)

For starters we had the tempura shrimp with other battered veggies, mini corn and even broccoli. Very tasty. For mains we shared an indian vegetable curry alongside a deep fried sea bass with sweet and sour sauce. Scrumptious and filling.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-192.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-192.jpg)

On Sunday we headed back to the flower market, and travelled a bit further to the main food market, Talat Warorot, with the intention of taking lots of cool photos.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-197.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-197.jpg)

It felt like you could buy anything here, stalls piled high with every type of fruit, flower, vegetable, fish, rice and seafood. Open BBQs grilled whole squid, long curly sausages were paraded, chicken and meat joints laid out for all to see (freshness was in doubt), pink dragon fruit kept catching the eye, inside shelves were piled with different types of tea, sweets, fake flowers and even fireworks. Whole tables were devoted to super soakers, water guns for Songkran. Some kids were already in the water fighting spirit, spraying passers by.

From 12-3pm we were back at the pool, a common afternoon activity by now, the heat so intense it was impossible to do anything else.

Following the news of deaths in Bangkok amongst the Red shirt protests, we decided not to go to BKK, and instead rearranged flights and hotels so we could stay in Chiang Mai for Songkran. Our hotel staff, mainly Mr Tommy, were amazing. Mr Tommy called Air Asia on our behalf, getting us a later flight despite missing the 48hr window. He then gave us a room at Rimping Village at a discounted rate and proceeded to help us with getting refunds from the hotel we cancelled in Bangkok. Our moment of stress was quickly over and we could continue enjoying out honeymoon.

In BKK we were going to stay at the Lebua, perhaps eat at Breeze or Bo.lang, and go to Siram Niramit theatre - end it all with a bang.

Leaving the hotel later than planned, we got a tuk-tuk into town for the Sunday walking market. Stalls were set along the old town’s main roads, selling all sorts of Thai wonders.  

The street food was particularly good and we tried noodles for 15B and an indian vegetable and chicken samosa. The products on sale were also better, more wide ranging and cheaper than at the night market.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-24.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-24.jpg)

With Songkran approaching the market was far more busy than normal, it got so busy it was impossible to stop and look at the homemade crafts, carvings, t-shirts or jewellery, or any stall. When we found a suitable exit we ducked out and went home, all marketed out.

<!--nextpage-->

On Monday we decided to get out of town on a day trip, whilst the traffic let us. We hired a taxi, with driver Mr Jagvech, and took a two hour drive south to Doi Inthanon.

On the major roads, lined up on either side, were groups of kids, families and teens with barrels full of water, water guns and buckets, soaking every car, moped and truck that came past. Our taxi was water tight and our driver unfazed.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-213.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-213.jpg)

To the tunes of Rhinestone Cowboy and The Young Ones, we sped south through “HOT”, to the mountains which slowly emerged from the haze. Up we climbed for 30 mins, winding around, ears popping every so often.

At the summit, the highest point in Thailand, it was a cool 25C, apparently perfect for birds and bird watching. On the Ang Thon nature trail we kept quiet, hoping to spot something nearby. Movement and the odd fluorescent dash of colour caught our eye as we spotted Yellow-bellied fantails, Green-tailed sunbirds and a brave Chestnut-tailed Minla that kindly posed for photos.

At the cafe we sampled locally grown Arabica coffee, whilst sharing stories with a family from Bangkok, up north for Songkran.

Further down the mountain were two towers dedicated to the King and Queen for their 80th birthdays. With spicy minced beef in our bellies, we perused the gardens and structures, taking note of the fantastic mountain peaks poking out of the hazy horizon. We posed for photos amongst the snap dragons and cabbages, and the cute little pond crossing.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-222.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-222.jpg)

Further down the mountain we made one final stop at a signposted waterfall, a roaring drop with viewpoints and large pools to bathe in, despite the no swimming signs.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-224.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-224.jpg)

On the way back we had more of the country-rock soundtrack and Songkran car soakings. By now the groups had perfected their bucket aims and we watched as most targets were drenched with perfectly launched throws.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-231.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-231.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-232.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-232.jpg)

That evening we ate at “The Good View”, along the river. Inside the décor had been filled with buckets, and our Mai Tai cocktails were the same; a wedge of pineapple on the side of a bright yellow bucket filled with alcohol. A band at the back played Elton John covers whilst we ate our mains. Deep fried and spicy serpent head fish with a mango salad and rice served in a pineapple.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-26.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-26.jpg)

Back at the hotel we ordered our favourite fruit shakes and spent the rest of the evening chatting with the restaurant and reception staff, Mr Tommy et al. Everything from Chiang Mai festivities to peculiar Hindu traditions with people dressed like dementors from Harry Potter.

<!--nextpage-->

Tuesday was the first day of Songkran, the new year festivities, to:
Say sorry to the river for dirtying it,
Respect elders
Have some fun

We were up early, packing for our room move, turned out we didn’t have to go anywhere and could stay in the same room. Sam got a taxi at 9am to go for an out of town one on one vegetable carving session. She learnt how to carve carrots into leaves, tomatoes into roses, cucumbers into lotuses and guava and watermelon into pretty structures. Meanwhile, I worked hard at the pool, perfecting my sunbathing techniques.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-29.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-29.jpg)

At 3pm we ventured into the city, ensuring any belongings we took with us were waterproofed.

The Nawara bridge was closed to traffic and lined with bucket wielding, water gun toting Thais of all ages. Sprinklers were mounted on both sides of the bridge, creating an archway of water into the city. Welcome to the water festival.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-30.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-30.jpg)

Crossing the bridge, bone dry, we were obvious targets. In the traditional manner, wide-grinned Thais poured water over our shoulders and wished us a happy new year, we reciprocated.

A procession (or cavalcade to Sam) came down the road, playing instruments, carrying flowers or images of Buddha, wearing traditional dress, dancing and holding banners. Soaking them was fair game, in fact they became prime targets. One elderly lady, with her cup of water, made sure to wet as many as possible.

Following the parade down the road the numbers grew. Time to load up on some water weapons: a 300B pump action super soaker and bucket. Fill up and we’re in the fight. Sam indiscriminately poured her cups of water over those least expecting, whilst I ducked and covered in cat and mouse water fights. With each step closer to the city the fight grew less civilised. 

A permanent grin was attached to our faces (and everyone else’s), with the pure unadulterated joy of soaking a complete stranger amidst the 40C heat.

We reached the edge of the old city. Enter the music stages, the pumping music, the pubs and food stalls, the party atmosphere, and most importantly of all, the Chiang Mai moat - an unlimited water supply. Here the water fight went up a notch. Water guns were supersized.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-31.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-31.jpg)

Groups lined the moat, throwing buckets in, pulling them out full and launching them at anyone. The roads were still open, adding to the chaos, as all vehicles were fair game. Trucks with barrels on the back and groups with buckets or pistols had mammoth battles with moat dwellers, mopeds weaving between trucks would be carrying passengers on the back firing their water soakers into the air. 

<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kqkvPkT78Nw&hl=en_GB&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kqkvPkT78Nw&hl=en_GB&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>

The beat pumped louder, and with each big chorus the water flew, the roads became rivers. Ice blocks were sold at corners, for that extra shiver inducing squirt and hilarious shriek. At 41C no one was cold.

DUNK! Sam gets five buckets of ice cold over her as she attempts to refill her blue elephant water (back) pack (notorious for having its connecting tube fall out and pouring water down your back).

<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/JKpYPGzUqec&hl=en_GB&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/JKpYPGzUqec&hl=en_GB&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>

Around the moat we fought, laughing at the superb surprise attacks whilst dodging the odd bucket load, smiling at the puny water guns people used, or those with built in umbrella shields, or the strange wolverine-like arm mounted ones.

Water trodden trainers were traded for oversized flip flops, and road side pancakes and noodles kept us sated (whilst sushi and wasabi blew my head off).

We danced and played and laughed until the sun went down; clear skies over the Chiang Mai city walls turned orange and the party went on.

We sat in Ratana’s kitchen, dripping wet, making puddles on the floor. Nothing like some chicken noodles, spicy beef and jasmine rice to refuel on.

Wednesday was much the same, day two of Songkran and the water festival continued.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-239.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-239.jpg)

Post-breakfast swimming, relaxing and a little bit of sleeping. Our honeymoon in Thailand was almost over. Our first taste of Asia had been incredible; from the tropical fruits, islands and beaches to the spicy curries, tuk-tuks and friendly hotel staff. We had paradise, bliss, adventure and a little bit of magic.

Heading out into the city one last time, we prepared for more water fighting madness. We threw buckets of water over trucks with perfect accuracy (or narrowly missing by several foot), reloaded with ice cold water, discarded water guns like Neo and got utterly and completely drenched. Donning straw/banana leaf hats we made our last few attacks and walking back to the hotel (squelch, squelch), our hearts were contented.

At the night market we made our final purchases - mango wood carvings, food and earrings included. 

Then it was time to say good bye. Good bye Chiang Mai with your Wats and moat; bye bye Rimping Village, bye Mr Tommy, with your great big smile; bye to the restaurant staff that knew our orders, prepared with a smile and even shared recipes; bye bye reception where we shared stories, made friends and learnt a bit of culture; bye bye guests and friends.

Bye bye lizards, mosquitos, jasmine, lotus plants, rice and noodles. Bye bye Thailand, with all your charm and beauty. We’ll be back.
