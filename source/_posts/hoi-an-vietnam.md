To Vietnam, from Brighton. One train, three flights and a taxi transfer, over 24 hours. With Emirates, we flew from Gatwick to Dubai, we spotted the world's tallest building from the airport, and then on, to Saigon, and a very tight connection to Da Nang, which included our visa applications. We arrived in Hoi An, and our hotel, at midnight, and we relished a shower and a comfortable bed.

It's now our first day in Hoi An. We're staying at the rather luxurious Life Heritage Resort, on the edge of town, about ten minutes walk into the centre. The walls are a subtle pink, the foliage luscious and the atmosphere tranquil. A perfect, relaxing introduction to the holiday.

The travelling took its toll, three flights a train and a taxi and we were exhausted. Yet we didn't sleep well, and at 9am, a little dreary, not really jet lagged, we had to adjust to the climate. A very humid 25C. It grows to the hight thirties in the day, at least until the rains come.

Dainty, we had our breakfast, the usual coffee and fruit juices, the more exotic fruits — mango, dragonfruit, pineapple, some noodles (I love noodles for breakfast) and various mini breads. We sat on the Senses restaurant balcony and overlooked the river. A motor boat chugged past, followed by a man in a pyramidal straw hat, rowing his small thin wooden boat. Calm, wonderful.

The skies were clear, a relief after all the weather forecasts that suggested constant storms and downpours. It is of course the start of the rainy season. And Hoi An is known to suffer badly, the river often rising 1m, and more recently, 2m causing havoc with the bohemian town. The humidity is however overbearing, a constant sauna, the only break being our dry air-con, whirring away to keep our room comfy at 25C. I'm not sure how we'll cope without it later in the holiday.

Unlike normal, I was raring to go and Sam was little drowsy, I left Sam to sleep it off and set out exploring my first taste of Vietnam alone. In my shorts, hat and sunglasses, camera slung around my neck, I was the obvious western tourist.

One step outside the hotel grounds. “Hello sir! Laundry? Clean, cheap, nice”. Then the next shop, “Hello! You buy something!”. And that's how it is in Hoi An, hounded for the most part, usually by young children trying to sell flashing toys, candles or raincoats, depending on the time and weather. You get used to it.

Moving slowly onwards, smiling at the shopkeepers urging me into their stores, but keeping a brisk pace, I headed into old town Hoi An.

Only a small town, the roads are utterly ridiculous. As one guide put it, the road markings are decorative. People mostly stick to one side of the road, mostly, it's more guidance. At cross roads you blindly drive through, don't stop whatever you do, but beep your horn to let everyone know you're coming. Red scooters, black motorbikes, everyone wearing a small helmet, it all seems to just work, the meandering is never ending, it just ebbs and flows. Cars passing bikes, passing scooters, dodging cyclists, avoiding pedestrians who are walking around street dealers; four levels deep overtaking on a road that is wide enough for two cars. I couldn't help but smile, this was insane.

I did a small lap of the old town, enough to take in my surroundings, to absorb the heat, to build up a sweat and to happily return to the hotel's pool to cool off. “How old are you? 15?” the bar attendant asked, aghast at my real age, and surprised I was married.

Sam emerged from her slumber and we chillaxed by the stone shallow pool, with its warm water, sun beds and bar. With fruit shake in hand, we read about Hoi An in the Lonely Planet and planned our time.

Storm clouds grew in the distance, the rumble of thunder got louder, and closer, an ever threatening presence. But the rain never came, it passed us by, the sun stayed out and we remained in the pool.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Poolside snacks - spring rolls, beef and prawns](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hoi-an-130.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hoi-an-130.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Poolside snacks - spring rolls, beef and prawns</figcaption></figure>

That evening, a Sunday night, we headed out into town, this time together. The evening changes Hoi An, the lanterns come on, red, yellow, different shapes, hung outside most shops. The roads become “walking streets”, and there's a relaxed casual atmosphere about the place, less hustle and bustle, although still the hard sells.

Passing the market place on the way into town, old women sat in the road, their fresh fish sitting in upturned lids and baskets. Live shrimp hopped from one basket to another, amidst piles of fresh fruit. The smell of durian in the air, pungent and unmistakeable. Bikes whizzed by, pulling across in front of us to buy 30,000 VND of this, or that, noodles, vegetables, meat, and so on.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--portrait">[![A purple evening in Hoi An](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hoi-an-132.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hoi-an-132.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">A purple evening in Hoi An</figcaption></figure>

On the skyline another storm was brewing, and this one was certainly heading right for us. We explored the little Japanese bridge at the far end of town, again, with red lanterns and pretty lights. The atmosphere was buzzing, a camera crew were waiting, and there were chairs lining the river. Something was going to happen but we had no idea what. And we wouldn't find out either.

Earlier that night, when I'd suggested perhaps we should take the wet weather gear, Sam casually replied, “No, we'll just get wet”. Oh did she rue those words. As the heavens opened and the deluge began, we hopped from shop to shop hoping to find the restaurant we were looking for. Not quite sure how the road map married up to the mish-mash of mini streets and paths we were exploring.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![An evening on the river in Hoi An, as the rain starts](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hoi-an-135.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hoi-an-135.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">An evening on the river in Hoi An, as the rain starts</figcaption></figure>

Eventually, more by blind luck, we stumbled on “Morning Glory”. Inside an open kitchen filled the restaurant, with tables surrounding it. Two women prepared fresh rice wraps and noodles in front of us.

For starters we shared barbecued beef skewers in sesame seeds, which we removed from their sticks and placed in a rice wrap with a thin rectangular noodle, and oodles of fresh herbs - thai basil, coriander, mint. Scrumptious, and washed down with local Larue beer, a light sort of lager.

Feeling almost full, clearly our appetite hadn't yet adapted to the climate, water, surroundings or whatever, the mains arrived, and we paced ourselves.

A smokey aubergine dish with sticky rice, the smokey flavour matched the flavouring used in bacon crisps, and I took an instant dislike to it. The dish was tasty, just not to my tastes. The second dish was the venerable Vietnamese Pho, beef with fresh herbs in a soupy broth. Really quite delicious. Lovely.

We couldn't eat any more, but the rain kept pouring. We got the bill and paid very slowly, yet still the rain continued. We eventually made a mad dash for it, the equivalent of jumping under a shower fully clothed. We made it three shops down to a lovely stylish cocktail bar called Q, pumping out Moby in the damp night air.

A whiskey based Saigon Express for me and a chocolate daiquiri for Sam, accompanied with dragonfruit crisps, which, strangely, we could eat now. As the drinks went down and the chillout soundtrack played, the rain paused and we explored night time Hoi An again.

Back towards the Japanese bridge, where the rain had rudely interrupted us, and there was a concert in full swing. On stage a guy dressed as Pikachu was rapping, there was much jumping, shouting and light flashing, in the sky and on the stage.

We crossed over the river and watched from afar, taking pictures of Hoi An at night, looking beautiful with its lanterns all reflecting in the water. On the bridge swathes of tourists; western, chinese, vietnamese alike, took their photos alongside the lanterns and the views. A warm, relaxing and safe atmosphere.

The sky threatened again, and not wishing to become drenched once more, we headed back. The skies opened just as we got to our hotel, perfect timing.

Before bed we nipped about the hotel, snapping photos of the heavy rain and the large toads that now occupied the paths.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Grumpy moustache toad](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hoi-an-151.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hoi-an-151.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Grumpy moustache toad</figcaption></figure>

Day two, up a little earlier, a quicker breakfast and off out and about in Hoi An by 10am. This time we were on bikes, large steel framed hotel bikes with a basket for our bags.

Guided by our simple map, we headed out into the mayhem that is Vietnamese roads, without cycle helmets, going East in search of the beach.

The meanderings of bikes come without signalling, there's no sign whether a bike is about to turn right, cutting in front of you, or if you can cross at the t-junction. There is however a helpful beep to let you know they are passing.

But our journey was without any hairy moments, and beyond the initial terror, it was pleasant, the warm air blowing in our faces, the occasional shade, a rare opportunity to overtake someone. It was only 6km to Cua Dai beach, but in the heat it felt longer.

With bikes parked under a shelter, a compulsory 10,000 VND charge, we collapsed on the shaded sand, beneath towering coconut trees. Of course we checked there were no dangerous, ripening coconuts set to fall on us.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Cua Dai beach](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hoi-an-152.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hoi-an-152.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Cua Dai beach</figcaption></figure>

The sand beyond this shaded retreat was roasting, sandals were the only option. Up the coast, to the north, you could see Da Nang and the day's storm clouds forming over the mountains. The sea was calm, but the waves large enough to surf on, crashing into the coast with great force. Force enough to strip me of my sandals and almost my shorts, I held onto both, and, as a weak swimmer, opted for only mild paddling from thereon.

We chilled beneath the coconut leaves for an hour or so, before retreating to the nearby Hoi An beach resort, a luxury hotel for a spot of food and a cheeky dip in their pool. A serene setting alongside the river, we watched as men fished with great orange nets. Still somewhat delicate, or just dehydrated, we stuck to simple western salads and fresh mango juice. (Oh the mangos, the succulent tasty mangos!)

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Fishing next to Hoi An beach resort](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hoi-an-158.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hoi-an-158.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Fishing next to Hoi An beach resort</figcaption></figure>

Freshened up, glowing slightly red from the sun, we hopped back on the bikes and took the scenic route home, south towards Cam Thanh. We cycled past a small local school, where the gates were being painted pink, past rice paddies, through small villages, alongside scant oxen, and mini corn harvesters, and past an out of the way but rather large graveyard, with modern looking gravestones.

With another storm cloud looming, we cycled back along Tran Nhan Tong. With a bit of iPhone GPS, use of the map, intuition and blind luck, we found an unmapped road that took us directly to the back of our hotel, over a small stream I was sure wouldn't have a bridge. And that concluded the mini cycling adventure, baby steps with Vietnamese roads.

That evening Sam wandered out in to Hoi An to purchase some made to measure dresses and coats at fabulous prices. I meanwhile meandered around taking photos, using the tripod to capture some night shots.

Despite bumping into each other twice on our own little missions, we reconvened at the bridge to go for dinner at Mango Mango, a highly recommended restaurant that fused western and vietnamese dishes.

There was a hard sell on the 800,000 five course set menu, we instead opted for a Miss Saigon starter (noodles, fresh herbs, mango, duck) and shrimp wontons with a fruity sauce. And for mains, a leg of duck confit served in a clay pot alongside floury wraps and a rather rare duck breast served with rice.

Despite the rave reviews we were disappointed by the meal. The portion sizes were way off, when the starter appeared it was greeted with, “that's a starter?”. I couldn't possibly have eaten both the starter and main, and being a starter, I left some of it in anticipation of the later duck course. Sadly this didn't taste great, was huge, and in the hot humid heat I really didn't fancy the stew they served up. Ah well. The french folks next to us seamed to enjoy their meals much more. (I do believe Sam is now suffering, a day later, from the after effects of this).

Another night, another downpour, but this time we came prepared, with huge golf umbrellas. And once more I relaxed in Q with a mojito, Sam elsewhere arranging her clothe purchases.

The streets turned to rivers and in the dark humid wet we skipped home, umbrellas keeping us mostly dry.

A 6:45am rise on a holiday is not my idea of fun or relaxation. But that's the time the iPhone alarm went off as we were heading out very early for the Red Bridge cookery course.

At the Hai Cam cafe in old town Hoi An for 8am, we joined Lindsey from Chicago for a day long adventure in vietnamese ingredients and cuisine. Just the three of us along with our guide for the day, Susan, we drove off in an air conditioned mini bus, first stop Tra Que Organic village.

Tra Que is basically a large herb farm where no pesticides are used. Susan picked out the thai basil, with its aniseed flavouring; lemon basil, which was very lemony; row after row of spring onion; tall lemongrass; vietnamese mint, very peppery; sweet potatoes, the leaves can be used in salad; papaya trees, small but with large fruits; water spinach with enormous leaves; and some rogue 'English' mint, the mint we already know, and the type used in mojitos.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Tra Que herb garden](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hoi-an-174.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hoi-an-174.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Tra Que herb garden</figcaption></figure>

We stopped at a family home for some refreshment. Complimentary water, ginger, sugar and small dark translucent vietnam basil seeds, it looked like frog spawn, and before telling us what it was, Susan joked that's what it actually was. We finished up with some lessons in banana leaf jewellery.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--portrait">[![Frog spawn drink](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hoi-an-176.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hoi-an-176.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Frog spawn drink</figcaption></figure>

Back in the air conditioned van and to the local market. Susan guided us through the carnage that is the buying and selling of fresh food; complete with horrors and delights.

Piled high were dragonfruit, green vietnamese oranges, cucumbers, pineapples, aubergines, carrots and banana flowers (some of which we bought for later).

To the seafood section, with shrimp, prawns, mackerel, crab, sardines, squid, red snapper, octopus and even sting ray. And then around to the horrors of the meat section. Live toads trapped in bags, queuing before being skinned alive. Pigs noses and all sorts of meat joints being chopped with cleavers; waste not want not, meat falls on the bloody market floor, that's ok, just pick it up again, and carry on.

Then there were the eggs. Duck eggs, quail eggs, and so on. And then the fertilised eggs, the eggs that contain the half formed baby ducklings and chicks. Our guide bought two for her breakfast. We were intrigued.

We had just a couple more things to pick up for the cooking. Some more herbs, some rice noodles, a banana flower. We tasted some more oddities too, a leaf that had a distinct mustardy aftertaste, ah, it clicked, this is wasabi. Or more, wasabi is made from the roots of this.

Sam picked up a weird looking vegetable, “Bitter melon”, Susan told us. We tried a bit, eugh, yes, that's bitter alright, but more like a pepper. A really bitter pepper.

Back to the van and south east to the Red Bridge cooking compound. Newly built and very stylish, it housed a swimming pool, a couple of cooking areas and a restaurant, all alongside a calm river. We relaxed by the pool with some drinks before beginning our cooking lessons. Susan called us over so we could [have a look at her duckling](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hoi-an-181.jpg) before she ate it, even offering us to try, but we turned her down. “Keeps you young and strong”, she said.

For a moment I watched a crazy thought pass through Sam's head, “should I try it?”, “hmmm”, I was ready to dive in and tell her not to.

Our first lesson was a simple crispy shallot recipe. A garnish that's used on everything in Vietnam. Chop up the shallots, cook them in lots of fat, drain and voila. A little like cheese and onion crisps if you ask me.

We were going to make a beef pho, and to begin we needed a good broth. We barbecued some lemongrass, an onion and several random bones of beef. When ready, we cleaned them off in a boiling pan of water, and then moved to a second pan, which would become our broth. A cleaner, less fatty broth mixture, less skimming required. A very useful tip.

We'd leave that broth cooking for a long while. Next we prepared some chilli, sugar and salt to make a pho garnish. Mostly just chopping and talking.

Pho also needs rice noodles. We were shown how to make a rice noodle mix; soaking rice in water until translucent and then rigorously blending to form a thick but smooth white mixture. We spread this mixture thinly and evenly over muslin stretched across a pan of boiling water. One Vietnamese minute later and we had our cooked mixture. Skewering carefully with a bamboo stick, we lifted the noodle from the cooking drum onto a plate, carefully folding as instructed. A little bit of oil, and some lengthways slicing and we each had our noodles! Easy, interesting and exciting.

While cooking, we snacked on the spare rice noodle circles, placed within a crunchy sesame seed rice cake and dipped in a chilli sauce.

The appetiser dish was lemongrass shrimp. With a wooden pestle and mortar we ground up lemongrass, chilli, shallots, sugar, salt and pepper. Then we mixed in the uncooked shrimps and wrapped carefully in several layers of banana leaf, all ready to be barbecued. Really easy and simply scrumptious, we will be making this a lot!

On to the next dish, clay pot fish, or mackerel with fresh dill and turmeric. We split the tasks on this one, I ground up the turmeric, and ran the risk of staining my clothes, Sam chopped the mackerel into 1cm cubes and Lindsey chopped up the dill (which comes from north Vietnam where it's cooler). With the smashed up turmeric we again added salt, sugar, pepper, and the usual, before cooking in oil. I stirred the oil continuously until it came to the boil, then added a few cups of water the fish and the dill, and left it to cook on the gas hob. It became quite stew like, and the chef later garnished with nuts before serving

By now our Pho broth was cooked up and ready to eat. Pouring the broth over our thinly sliced beef cooked it instantly. We combined it with our noodles and a variety of fresh herbs we'd picked earlier in the day. It's the fresh herbs that make it special, such a powerful fresh flavour. We put chillies on top and washed it all down with Tiger beer.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Our beef Pho](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hoi-an-211.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hoi-an-211.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Our beef Pho</figcaption></figure>

One final dish for us to prepare. A simple chicken, or in Lindsey's case, calamari, salad. Group work again, we grated papaya, cucumber and carrot. And added chilli and lemon, before marinating the chicken/calamari in a soy, fish sauce, salt and sugar combination.

The chefs went away and cooked this while we relaxed by/in the pool. We drunk our complimentary wine and discussed American politics, travelling around East Asia and the varying ways the UK, US and Vietnam are different.

We gathered around the table to eat our now ready salad, mountains of delicious food. Once again, we picked from a variety of herbs to garnish our salad and build its flavour. A useful exercise, though we made the mistake of not snapping the water spinach stalks.

With the day edging on, the clouds began to appear, build up and look threatening. We moved to the main restaurant to eat our final dish, the fish in clay pot, and to pick up aprons, recipes and tidbit utensils.

With the sky ready to rain down on us, we skipped the boat ride back home and took the minibus back, changing into our wet weathers on the way. We said goodbye to Lindsey, and I left Sam to revisit all the clothing shops to pickup her orders, try things on and make adjustments.

Meanwhile I simply relaxed by the room, typing out this here blog on my iPad, outside in the humid hot afternoon, the rain hammering down beyond the porch.

[Right now I'm in Hue, our next stop, sipping a watermelon milkshake, sitting in the hotel bar, listening to chill out nondescript music.]

Our final night in Hoi An, we were ready to move on. But this place really is lovely. The coloured lanterns that hang in the shop windows on the waterfront give the place a magical atmosphere. As do the occasional candles that float downstream.

We took in the sights once more, and ticked the boxes that hadn't been ticked: the small market over the bridge in An Hoi; crossing the Japanese bridge and visiting that part of town; buying stylish trinkets. For once it wasn't raining, the moon and the stars were out whilst a storm in the distance occasionally dazzled us with a light show.

We settled on the Cargo Club restaurant for our evening meal, it came with a lovely balcony seat overlooking the serene river. There's a Hoi An specialty we hadn't yet tried, Cao Lau. Dark yellow noodles, a pork broth, beansprouts, with various greens and salad. Sam knew she was eating this, while I had a crispy pork salad. All very tasty, and accompanied with a chilled white vietnamese coffee. The downstairs delicatessen looked great, so we finished up with a mango cheesecake and a passion fruit cake.

Our time in Hoi An was coming to a close, and we were sad to be leaving, despite all the “you buy something?” and tourist haggling (part and parcel of any trip to Vietnam), this place is really quite special.

We wandered the streets back to the Life Heritage Resort on the edge of town, past the closed market and beneath the big banyan tree with all its lanterns.

Goodbye Hoi An, you're too charming.
