In 2011 Samantha and I ran the Olympic games ticketing website gauntlet, and in the public ballot we came away with tickets for two Olympic events; hockey and table tennis. Then in the second round, getting up at 6am, Sam nabbed basketball, canoe sprint and volleyball. A good haul.

One year later and it was time for the games to begin. Day one of the London 2012 Olympics. After seven years of planning, preparations, new hotels, new venues, an excellent and fun 'get ahead of the games' campaign, the ticket buying fiasco, the hoo-ha over the logo and goodness knows what else, the time had come.

<iframe width="580" height="326" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/66molzUEkWI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Pink signs adorned London stations, along with new snake like queuing systems. But on this morning it was all quiet, like the calm before the storm. The visitors hadn't arrived yet and the Londoners were on holiday. London was empty, if only for a day.

Time for Danny Boyle’s opening ceremony. I turned on the HDTV, whacked up the volume and waited, with a half made cup of tea sitting in the kitchen. I had zero confidence this would be any good. The ten minute snippet at the end of the Beijing games made me embarrassed, I was convinced this would be more of the same.

And then it started. All that waiting over. Fuck Buttons opened the show, then Jerusalem, and then a field of green, filled with ploughs, sheep, cricket and maids. The olde time England.

Enter the industrial revolution. The dancing capitalists in top hats and Kenneth Brannagh as Brunel. To tribal music the fields were ripped up, rolled up, removed, the greenery torn apart. Out of the ground grew five huge chimney stacks. And in came workers, labourers. The country was built from the ground up, and in the middle a ring was forged. A huge glowing ring.

It began to rise, and from the edges of the stadium four more rings appeared, forming a giant Olympic logo in the centre of the stadium, burning bright, looking brilliant. Incredible. My draw dropped, I was astonished. This was simply brilliant, perfectly British and awesome, in all meanings of the word. I was bouncing with glee, and my Twitter stream was pouring with support. No one could quite believe it, Danny Boyle had pulled it off.

How to top that? What about James Bond with the actual queen, flying to the arena by helicopter and parachuting in to the Bond theme tune.

Next, a tribute to the NHS and children's literature. Kids trampolines on lit up beds, as giant creatures swarmed the centre, until an army of Mary Poppins's saved the day.

Enter pop culture, and a resounding tribute to the last five decades of british music, wrapped in a technological envelope of SMS, tweets and instant messaging. The culmination? The centrepiece house rises up to reveal Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the Internet, [live tweeting](https://twitter.com/timberners_lee/status/228960085672599552) from the machine he invented the web on. My twitter stream exploded. Another astonishing thing no one could believe. Web geeks were united, as our hero became everyone's hero. His tweet, one web, adorned the pixels the crowd held.

And now the Olympians, the athletes, alphabetically, for a few hours, country by country, a geography lesson and the realisation of how big the Olympics are: 204 countries are here, the world's eyes are on us. A perfect time for a tea break and to check the Internet again, following along with everyone else, sitting quietly with Sam, but sharing the moment with the world.

And to the finale. Beckham arriving by speedboat down the Thames with the torch, handed to Redgrave, who runs it into the arena, as hundreds of bikers dressed as neon doves circle the stadium, whilst the Arctic Monkeys sing out.

Finally, the passing of the torch, to seven young athletes, who light the copper petals, which rise to form a beautiful symbolic Olympic torch. Queue fireworks. Magnificent.

On the first sporting day of the Olympics I was up early and watched as much sport as possible from the offset. We were hot favourites in the road race, the shooting was on, as was archery and the first swimming heats. Suddenly an abundance of sport, everywhere, non-stop, for two weeks. All day on BBC One, BBC Three, BBC HD and dedicated olympic channels. All sports streamed live on the BBC website.

At Heather’s (Sam’s mum), after a BBQ, we watched more sporting events. I winced as we missed out gold in the road race, and was surprised to see strong swimmer Phelps not doing his best, not even medalling in one event. And we watched Australia’s women’s Basketball team beat Team GB.

It was more of the same at Stuart’s (Sam’s dad), after lunch we watched the women’s road race, and cheered as Lizzie Armistead came second, our first medal of the games. The sailing was underway, but Ainslie had got off to a bad start. The archery was on at Lord’s. And in the evening, with what would soon become a daily ritual, we screamed at the TV as the swimmers raced for the finish line.

My first event was men’s hockey, on the first Wednesday of the games. I went with Marek from Last.fm and after work we took the javelin train from King’s Cross to Stratford, smooth, effortless travel to the Olympic Park. Through Westfield shopping centre and then security with their airport scanners and ticket inspectors, all very friendly and jovial, we entered the park.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-002.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-002.jpg)

With an ear-to-ear grin I walked through the brand new park, firstly past the swooping aquatic centre and beneath the huge welcome signs, then past the beautiful stadium, the odd twisted orbit sculpture, the TV studios, the London 2012 megastore, the handball arena, the Coke beat-box, and the park live big screen, to the back, to the blue and pink hockey stadium, the Riverbank Arena.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-006.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-006.jpg)

We climbed to our seats and settled down for the first of two games. Our view looked out across the park and London’s skyline. Canary wharf, the stadium, the orbit, the cable cars, the dome. A fabulous backdrop for this sporting event.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-007.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-007.jpg)

Argentina vs. Pakistan was the first match, with [Pakistan beating Argentina 2-0](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/hockey/event/men/match=hom400a06/index.html), in a sloppy opening game. Second up came Germany vs South Korea. We watched with Heineken and Pain au chocolat in hand, and at first cheered the Germans, Marek is after all German. But soon they were 1-0 up, and the Koreans were playing impressively. Breaking forward with excellent passing and individual skill. The arena roared, “KO-RE-A, KO-RE-A”, and they kept pushing. A penalty corner, but no conversion, a deflection, but no goal. 10-9-8, the seconds counted down, it was over, and [Germany had won 1-0](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/hockey/event/men/match=hom400b06/index.html). Fabulous excitement.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-010.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-010.jpg)

On our exit, famous folk bid us farewell from large screens. Simon Pegg warned us to mind the gap, Charlize Theron waved goodbye. The smiling, enthusiastic volunteers waved us goodbye, and politely, kindly, ushered us all to the exit.

Back out through Westfield, where volunteers pressed music to their megaphones and spontaneously danced, down to the underground, where another volunteer urged us to the end of the platform with promises of cake and a VIP party. These volunteers were incredible, so friendly, so helpful, and what an atmosphere they cultivated. Where there would be queues, congestion and frustration there was movement, laughter and joy. Fantastic.

That night I stayed over in London, and, after work again, I met Sam at Earl’s Court in the south west of London for a bout of men’s indoor volleyball. I’d been watching the beach volleyball on the TV, and the atmosphere had been incredible.

Before it all started we gathered around a TV screen inside the venue to watch Chris Hoy take gold in the velodrome, making good on Pendleton’s previous disqualification in the women’s team sprint. With the win, there were roars of support, and the sitting supporters waved their union jack flags emphatically.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-016.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-016.jpg)

To our seats, high up in the rafters, the cheapest £20 tickets, but still with a good view. The opening match would be a classic, monsters in the volleyball world, [USA vs. Brazil](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/live-video/p00w2zz7). As we know, Brazilians know how to celebrate and cheer, and there was a raucous atmosphere as the game got underway.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-022.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-022.jpg)

Brazil narrowly took the first set 25-23, but lost out by a similar margin in the very tight second set, 27-25, despite having set point. We learnt about the stop-start sport as it progressed; the timeouts, the maximum number of touches, the dig and then the spike and the tactics. We strained to see when a point went one way or another, the subtle deflection or net touch hard to pick up without a TV and viewing from the stands. And in the breaks we watched the big screen bongo-cam, where the crowd pretended to play said instrument. It was loud, and every point was celebrated with a ten second snippet of “Got the power!”, or some other adrenaline pumping chorus.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-017.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-017.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-018.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-018.jpg)

After the second set the US took control, winning the next two sets in a row, 25-19, 25-17, to [win the match 3-1](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/volleyball/event/men/match=vom400b09/index.html). But the game itself was mammoth, going on a good 40 minutes longer than scheduled. The GBR (go team GB!) vs. ITA game was delayed starting, but soon got underway.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-019.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-019.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-020.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-020.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-021.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-021.jpg)

This was our only Team GB match, and as the 93rd seed versus the third best team in the world, we expected to lose. Still, we waved our flags, shouted and cheered for every single point. Half way through the first set we were holding our own, the red shirted guys combatting whatever the Italians threw at them, well, not throwing, that would be a foul. (See, we read the rules from Sam’s handy print-out). But [Italy ended the victors](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/volleyball/event/men/match=vom400a09/index.html), with a comprehensive 3-0 victory, 25-19, 25-16, 25-20.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-023.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-023.jpg)

Ashamedly we snuck out before the last point, avoiding the crowds and grabbing one of the last underground tubes to Turnpike Lane, where a friend put us up for the night. Two consecutive best-of-five-set volleyball matches is hard work, and we were shattered.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-026.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-026.jpg)

<!--nextpage-->

After a late night, 1am, we were up early, 6am, to travel to the Olympic Park, my second time, but Sam’s first. It has such a different feel than Earl’s Court, more than just a sports arena, it oozed character and its welcoming, warm, joyful atmosphere was unprecedented.

From underground, to Kings Cross, the snake like queue and the well organised javelin train service to Stratford, we made our way to the park. But not before a food stop at Waitrose, and a coffee and croissant on some leather sofas to start the day.

We were heading to see Women’s Basketball at the Basketball Arena. A large but temporary building, a tight white skin covered a protruding metal texture to create an almost organic look.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-027.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-027.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-029.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-029.jpg)

Rubbing the sleep out of our eyes, we focused on the court below, as the first match was about to begin. [Croatia vs. Angola](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/live-video/p00w300q), two struggling teams at the foot of their group. Not the tightest of matches, both in score and skill, it felt like a warm up game. But the crowd emphatically [cheered Croatia to victory 75-56](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/basketball/event/women/match=bkw400a10/index.html), although we’d rooted for Angola.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-030.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-030.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-031.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-031.jpg)

The half time entertainment was a display of gymnastics and basketball prowess, as players jumped from trampolines, somersaulting, passing the ball and scoring impressive baskets by all manner of means.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-032.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-032.jpg)

AUS vs RUS was up next. We’d seen Australia batter Team GB on the TV, and were happy to recognise the players again, notably the tall bulky captain, Laura Jackson. After the first quarter Australia were up 21-15, despite not making any of their three point attempts. This proved costly and by half time Russia had brought it back to 32-30\.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-034.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-034.jpg)

The second half time show showcased the talents of the local cheerleading squad, and we watched, bathed in pink light, as they tossed each other into the air. A momentary interlude, we switched our attention to my phone, where I streamed the rowing from the BBC olympics app, to see the women’s double sculls final and Team GB storm to victory.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-035.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-035.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-036.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-036.jpg)

Back to the match, and at the end of the third quarter it was 54-48 to AUS. To the final quarter, and Russia opened strongly, storming forward and scoring a rally of three pointers. With fifty seconds to go it was 68-66 to AUS, and Russia were giving it their all, coming forward once again, but missing that vital basket. Australia countered, and the stadium erupted with cheers as they made the two-point basket for a four-point advantage. And that’s how it ended, [70-66 to Australia](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/basketball/event/women/match=bkw400b10/index.html), a thrilling match to watch, right to the end.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-037.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-037.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-040.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-040.jpg)

Despite going to just one event in the park, we wanted to hang around for the rest of the day. The forecast had said rain, but it never came, instead there were blue skies, fluffy white clouds and hot sunshine. Outside the arena we watched as giant basketball players signed autographs.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-043.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-043.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-044.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-044.jpg)

We explored the swooping wooden velodrome, a beautiful permanent structure. And stood on tiptoes to try and see the BMX park. Atop a small grassy hill stood the Olympic rings in all their glory, with a queue to have a photo taken beneath them. Of course we queued, and befriended those ahead and behind us. Eventually it was our turn, and we jumped and  whooped, waving the union jack beneath the five rings. Snap, snap, snap.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-046.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-046.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-042.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-042.jpg)

We picnicked and slept on the grass of park live, watching [Jessica Ennis begin her heptathlon](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/schedule-results/athletics/20120803#start-time-1000) campaign on the big screen, watching [Ben Ainslie push The Great Dane in the sailing](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/sailing/event/finn-men/phase=sam002910/index.html) -- [slowing down and giving him dirty air](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/live-video/p00w305z), and Roger Federer struggling but eventually winning in the [tennis semi final](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/tennis/event/men-singles/match=tem001201/index.html).

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-045.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-045.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-051.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-051.jpg)

The day passed by, slowly and quietly, all rather lovely. In the evening we explored further, following the riverside walk, alongside the beautiful British flowers and Gloriana boat, as used to bring the torch to the stadium and to lead the jubilee flotilla. Then around the outside of the stadium (but not inside), sad to think, at the time, that we wouldn’t make it inside.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-060.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-060.jpg)

Penultimate stop, the London 2012 megastore, for some official olympic venue t-shirts and other paraphernalia we seemed happy to purchase. A key ring, a mug, and so on.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-057.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-057.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-058.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-058.jpg)

Before leaving we settled down with a large curry to share and watched Rebecca Addlington attempt to defend her Olympic 800m gold, streaming it again on my phone. Sat just metres away from the actual event, we cheered her on, and she [won an excellent Bronze medal](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/sports/swimming/events/womens-800m-freestyle).

We bought a bottle of wine and relaxed on the train home from St Pancras. A fantastic day.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-063.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-063.jpg)

<!--nextpage-->

Over the weekend we didn’t take a break, instead driving to our friends Tricia and Chris’s, north of Reading, for a BBQ and a university get together. On the drive up we listened to 5live and our two golds and a silver in the rowing. There was commentary on sailing too, and Victoria Derbyshire was very excited about everything.

Once there it was much of the same, seven of us chatted, but gathered around the TV watching whatever sport was on. A bit of trampolining, a bit of equestrian. Snacking on biscuits from a London 2012 tin.

Later we won the [Women's team pursuit in the Velodrome](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/cycling-track/event/women-team-pursuit/phase=ctw402100/index.html), smashing the world record. And then, what a phenomenal night of athletics. Jessica Ennis stormed home in the 800m to win gold in the women’s heptathlon. Shortly thereafter Mr. Rutherford put in an enormous jump to win Team GB the men’s long jump. And to top off the night, Mo Farah won the 10,000m in style, our first long distance medal winner, and utterly brilliant.

As [I’d tweeted](https://twitter.com/fofr/status/231855295373131777), what an incredible day to be watching the Olympics with friends. [Six gold medals and a silver](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19131859). And to top it off, a tasty late night barbecue with some rather scrumptious spicy BBQ’d prawns. Yum yum yum.

As the night drew on, and became morning, we played Xbox Kinect sports, making fools of ourselves as our computer characters flailed in the 100m, threw a javelin at the floor or simply battered down every single hurdle — but impressively still going on to win! There was a spot of bowling and beach volleyball too

The next morning I was rather subdued, but the hot chocolate croissants put pay to that. On the TV the women’s marathon was on, passing all the major sights of London. But outside it was bucketing it down, thunderous, horrible. A giant shower head of a cloud.

Cinema? Dark Knight Rises? Ok let’s go! A half hour drive to Reading, parked, just in time for the film… but they’d sold out. Alas, we found a pub, had some burgers and watched Andy Murray play Roger Federer at Wimbledon in the men’s tennis final. Again, another awesome thing to [watch](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/live-video/p00w314t) with friends, as [Andy thrashed Federer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19136775), breaking him five times, never losing a service match and winning in straight sets. Brilliant, Murray played like a different man.

On the drive home, 5live was on again, and Murray mustered up the energy for the mixed doubles final. Best of three sets, it went down to the last tiebreak, but it was all too much and the pair had to settle for silver. Another memorable sports moment in its own right.

Not too much action for the weekend? At home my mum was waiting for us, she’d driven from Bristol to come and see Table Tennis with me, on Monday. (And in the downtime we booked a flight to Cambodia).

But wait! There’s more sport! The unmissable [Men’s 100m final](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18907995) was tonight, with the man of the Olympics, Usain Bolt. Unlike Beijing, everyone knew who he was this time around, and they were waiting, expecting. There was a new Jamaican on the scene too, one Yohan Blake, who’s been known to beat Bolt in the past. We had a race on our hands.

Marks. Set. FIRE. And they’re off, Bolt and Blake break from the pack, a good few metres ahead now, but Bolt is pulling free, he’s leaning forward, he’s won. 9.63 seconds. An Olympic record. Blake second with a personal best 9.75\. But should we ever have doubted Bolt? Of course not. He retains his Olympic gold, and once again we’re awed. Despite breaking the record in Beijing, he actually ran faster tonight, just not as fast as his world record set in Germany of 9.58.

That left us buzzing, and it was hard to get to sleep.

A new week, another Olympic event. But first some excitement. All week I’d been constantly refreshing, hammering, the London 2012 ticketing website, desperately trying to buy athletics tickets. Something. Anything. By Monday, I’d almost given up, my obsessive checking hadn’t worked. But at 10am some tickets appeared (this had happened before, but to no avail), I added them to my basket and requested them. For once, the overly cached awful website didn’t fail at that step, at the “requesting...” spinning page it succeeded too, and on the “reserving...” step it also worked. Adrenaline pumping, I had 1m30s to buy these tickets, the fastest online purchase I’ve ever made. Success! Two athletics tickets on Wednesday night, including Usain Bolt in the 200m semi finals. We’d be inside the stadium, we’d see people winning medals and we’d see the Olympic torch. Awesome!

Back to today’s event though. And that evening I met my mum in London and travelled to the Excel Arena for some men’s table tennis action, specifically the team semi-final. A sport I was desperate to see in the original ballot, I’d purchased the more expensive seats, we couldn’t have been much closer to the table.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-064.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-064.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-065.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-065.jpg)

Outside the arena an exhibition showcased the history of Table Tennis, a glass enclosure held paddles from an early Olympic games, and on large boards the sport was explained. A big screen showed highlights of the earlier semi final.

Inside we found our seats, next to the friends and family area, beneath the media folk. Today’s match, South Korea vs. Hong Kong China. Korea were the favourites, inevitably the majority were rooting for Hong Kong China. Table Tennis team is best of five matches, with a team of three. Two singles matches, a doubles match and then another two singles. Each match is the best of five games, first to eleven.

The first match, Peng Tang (HKG) vs. Seungmin Ryu (KOR), was incredibly close. Serve, ping, pong, top spin smash, smashed return, point won. Every now and then the rally grew insane, both players edging away from the table, getting further and further back, smashing the small plastic white ball at each other, with incredible skill and accuracy. “Oooh”, “aaah”, the crowd gasped, as each player would do something extraordinary to return.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-068.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-068.jpg)

This match went to five games, 11-7, 4-11, 6-11, 11-8\. The final game stood poised at 9-9, the two best players poised to take their team 1-0 up. Serve, smash, and Korea were 10-9 up. Then a long rally, bam, saved, bam, saved, smash, return, then a delicate return shot from Korea, which just clips the net and drops the right side, match won, and Seungmin Ryu roars in celebration.

A short break, a warm up and on to the second match. Tianyi Jiang (HKG) vs Saehyuk Joo (KOR). This now became about one man, Saehyuk Joo, no matter how hard Jiang tried, Joo combatted perfectly. This player was clearly on another level, an enthralling defensive style. His tactic was simply to return every shot with unimaginable back spin and accuracy, taking the power from the ball. Jiang tried harder and harder to win points, smash following smash, but calm and collected, Joo stooped low to return a deft, perfectly poised shot, floating the ball back, until, inevitably Jiang made a mistake. Korea took this match easily, 11-3, 11-6, 11-8.

And to the doubles. WIth Korea 2-0 up the support for Hong Kong China grew, and huge roars for “HONG KONG” ran out amongst the crowd. Every point won was met with loud cheers. The doubles match was frenetic, players alternating shots, serving cross-table, once more with incredible rallies. Hong Kong took the first match, 11-5, but lost the following two, 6-11, 2-11\. In the fourth, Hong Kong pulled it back with a nervy edgy 13-11 victory. But it wasn’t enough, and Korea closed out the match 11-9, [winning the bout 3-0 overall](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/table-tennis/event/men-team/match=ttm400202/index.html).

Mum and I made the journey home, taking the DLR back to Bank, with a genuinely funny driver and receptive carriage of cheering international sports fans. At one point the train stopped, and the lights went out. “Wasn’t me”, the driver announced. Then the subdued crappy train back to Brighton, another late night.

And after that late night, Sam pulled me up at 5am(!) to get into a car and be driven to Eton Dorney, via a Windsor park and ride, for some early morning [Canoe Sprint action](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/schedule-results/canoe-sprint/20120807#start-time-0930). I brought a pillow and slept most of the journey, and Sam had the excellent forethought to provide fresh croissants and coffee from a thermos.

Running on sugar and caffeine, we meandered the walkways to the Eton Dorney ticket booths, not without their own pink monoliths and Wenlock statues. Orange and purple uniformed volunteers welcomed us, “Good morning”, they smiled, and, as usual, we passed through the security gates into the park.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-072.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-072.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-073.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-073.jpg)

A few breakfast places and shops, a try it yourself rowing room, and one huge stand lining the manmade lake made up Eton Dorney. An hour or so early, we meandered, eating our breakfast, wrapping up warm. It was a particularly blustery day, that threatened to shower, a day for which we’d be sitting outside.

Sat down in our expensive finish-line seats, we watched the big screen and the fella with a microphone, as they explained each of the sports. Kayak’s racers sit in their boat, and use a paddle with two blades, steering using their feet. Canoe however sees athletes kneel up and use only a single bladed paddle, looking very uncomfortable. The single blade seemed for the most part to stick to one side, and the steering performed at the tail end of the stroke. Slower, more technically difficult and really strenuous. And obviously, in both, first across the line wins.

At 9:30am, the first two heats, Men’s Kayak Four 1000m, or K4 1000m. In the distance, down the lake to our right, the men lined up. The starter beep goes, and they’re off, accelerating in unison. At the moment we’re watching the screens to see what’s going on, as they get nearer and nearer. Soon they’re level with us, and the leaders are battling it out for first place. Slovakia and Hungary won their respective races and qualified automatically. The rest would race later in the day for the last few final places.

At 9:46am the Men’s C2 1000m (C = Canoe) heats. Much slower this time, as expected. Germany won their heat with a time of 3:34.435, and Azerbaijan theirs, 3:38.042\. Angola were massively behind, finishing a long way back from the pack, but nonetheless the crowd cheered them on until they crossed the line.

At 10:07am, hurtling through these races now, the Women’s K1 500m heats. This set of races bothered us. In each race, bar the first, all six competitors would go through to the semi final, their positions in the heat deciding their lanes. This made the races a little lacklustre, except perhaps for the Iranian, the one racer out of 26 to be eliminated at this stage. Still, in heat four we cheered on our British hopeful Rebecca Cawthorn. Frantically waving our union jacks, and shouting “GO ON! GO ON!”, she won her heat to much applause.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-078.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-078.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-075.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-075.jpg)

Between races the compere kept us entertained, with the usual bongo cam, mexican wave rehearsals and variants and so on. Although the mexican wave doesn’t work so well when it just goes along in a straight line. You can’t see it approaching.

At 10:35am, the Women’s K2 500m. In this event Team GB were a last minute entry. We raced in the first heat. Again, we stood up, waved our flags, cheered and shouted, although this time to not so much avail, finishing fifth, but still qualifying for the semis.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-077.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-077.jpg)

With the heats out of the way we were on to the semis. First up, as before, at 11:01am, the Men’s K4 1000m semi. Australia won with a very fast 2:52.505 time. They went on to win the competition (we didn’t see that), but in the final actually went slower than this.

At 11:09am, the Men’s C2 1000m semi final. As usual, we arbitrarily picked our team to support, no team GB in any of the men’s races. Russia and China won these respectively. And the two runners up in each also went through to the final, Belarus, Romania, Czech Republic and Cuba. In the final, which we didn’t see, Germany went on to take gold.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-076.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-076.jpg)

Come 11:30am and we’re onto the Women’s K1 500m semis. 24 boats racing again, this time in the lanes they’d fought for, in three semi finals. In the third race we cheered on Rebecca Cawthorn again. A sea of red, blue and white appeared in the stands, and cheers followed Rebecca as she sped down the lake in her matching union jack styled kayak. She was narrowly second, by three tenths of a second, 1:52.542, but still comfortably qualifying for the final. Sadly in the final she didn’t medal, fighting it out with the Italian again, but only for 5th and 6th place.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-079.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-079.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-080.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-080.jpg)

And to the last races of the day, Women’s K2 500m. As expected, Team GB didn’t make it through the semis, finishing up seventh and long way back in the race. Still, it didn’t dampen our spirits and we cheered them on to the very end. Germany, China and Sweden won these semis,  with Germany eventually taking gold in the final.

And to the end of our Canoe Sprint experience, just in time for some lunch. Knackered, we slowly walked back to the park and ride, rode the leather seated First bus back to the car, and drove home again. We kept 5live on, and listened to the Brownlee brothers take gold and Bronze in the triathlon. Too tired to stop and visit Windsor castle, and at home too tired to do much other than sleep. We slept, for most of the day.

Canoe Sprint should have been our final event, but the luck of the ticketing website draw meant we had another, [athletics](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/schedule-results/athletics/20120808#start-time-1800). An opportunity to be in the stadium, to see the giant torch, to watch people achieve astonishing things, and to be back at the Olympic park.

We took a half day holiday, and headed over, via the javelin train, for one final time. This time we had a list of things to do; to buy “venue collection” t-shirts and to visit the Cola beat-box. Between 3pm and 6pm the park was at its busiest and we had to queue extensively for each of them. Disappointingly, the t-shirts we wanted were out of stock, already snapped up by the hordes of sports fans.

On to the next queue, standing in the beautiful sunshine, waiting to enter a giant beat-box. Red, and white, with pads and panels, as you walked around you could touch the pads to create noises, samples from different sports combined to form a beat, of sorts. As you climbed the song grew, layered. It wasn’t too exciting, and I was rushing, eager to get out and over to the stadium.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-083.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-083.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-084.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-084.jpg)

But at the top there’s a lovely view and a chance to hold the Olympic torch, we obliged. Holding the golden torch, it was lighter than expected, and the emblasoned London 2012 logo looked great. We stood on the plinth, held the torch and had our photos snapped. At the bottom there was free Coke, and a cult-like sugar rush party. But alas, we had to run.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-086.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-086.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-087.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-087.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-089.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-089.jpg)

Skipping across the park, past the BBC TV studio, to the Stadium, in through entrance B and over the moat. We’re in the stadium! We smiled, this was so exciting, this felt like the Olympics more than anything else, and we were here, soaking it up, beneath the clear blue skies and gorgeous summer evening. And our seats were fantastic, just above the 200m start line, long jump to our left, high jump to our right and javelin diagonally across. We could see everything, and the crown like spikes of the stadium surrounded us.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-090.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-090.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-092.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-092.jpg)

With a tasty curry and some beer, we settled down for the sporting action. The Men’s decathlon high jump began at 18:00, and we cheered on Suarez, the cuban, who jumped 2.11m, much higher than anyone else. At 19:05 the [javelin qualifying got underway](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/athletics/event/men-javelin-throw/phase=atm053900/index.html), whilst the high jump continued. Any throw over 80m meant automatic qualification. The Czech Vesely threw a monster 88.34m, the longest throw this year, a personal best, and almost breaking the Olympic record. (This was actually 4m longer than the gold medal winning throw in the final).

Come 19:15 it’s the turn of the Men’s 110m hurdles semi finals. Three semi-finals, we cheered on Team GB’s Clarke in the first and Turner in the second. Watching the hurdles, live, side-on is incredible. The speed with which they cover 110m, and the fluency of each jump. Very exciting.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-091.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-091.jpg)

Marks. Set. FIRE! And the stadium erupts, cheering, louder and louder for Clarke. 13.31 seconds, a personal best. Third in his race, just missing out on the automatic qualification. We anxiously watched the next two races, hoping that 13.31 would be fast enough to qualify for the final. Semi final 2, Xie of China gets 13.34, but Turner of GB misses out with 13.42\. Still in with a chance. Semi final 3, Fourie in third gets 13.28, but fourth place 13.35! Clarke makes it into the final, by the skin of his teeth. The stadium is buzzing.

The sun had dipped now, evening was closing in, and the sky and the stadium continued to look astonishing.

The Women’s 1500m semi finals now, 3.5 laps of the field, we had three GB hopefuls racing, with [Weightman and Dobriskey making it to the final](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19187983). As the women ran their laps, we watched the Women’s long jump warm up to our left, the decathlon high jump draw to a close, and the javelins continue to fly, with the occasional cheer for any that passed 80m.

At 20:10, the big event we’d all been waiting for. The 200m semi final, a race that would start right beneath us, and one that would feature the eponymous Usain Bolt, and the new star, Yohan Blake.

Yohan Blake was in the first semi. He warmed up beneath us, and wandered along the track waving to the crowds. Jamaican flags waved frantically. The cameras and announcer introduced each of the athletes, with Blake doing his “beast” routine to the screens.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-093.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-093.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-096.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-096.jpg)

They settled down and took their marks, the stadium hushed, silence, you could hear a pin drop. Set. FIRE! Blink and you’ll miss it, they leap from the starting blocks, and storm around the corner to our right. And now they were in the distance, crossing the finish line, 20.01s, Blake wins — just, 20.02, 20.03 second and third. [A very fast, very close semi](http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/athletics/event/men-200m/phase=atm002200/index.html). And the speed of these guys, seeing it in the flesh, incredible.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-097.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-097.jpg)

Usain Bolt was in the second semi. Suddenly the stadium was glimmering, flashes flickering everywhere, everyone taking a picture, “I was there, I saw this man run”, us included. Bolt raised his arm in acknowledgement, and there were cheers. He casually prepared, not phased in any sense, high fiving the lucky volunteer behind him. When the announcer introduced him, the stadium went a little crazy.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-094.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-094.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-101.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-101.jpg)

Once more they settled down in their lanes. Checked their feet against the starting blocks, measured their fingers against the white lines and prepared to race, Bolt doing his usual hail Mary. Silence again, 80,000 people hushed, waiting. Marks. Set — body raised up. FIRE! And Bolt storms ahead, taking the corner, gaining momentum and creating a widening gap. Half way round he knows he’s winning, and winning by some distance, he slows down, [and almost seems to jog the last 100m](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18907716). He wins, 20.18s.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-102.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-102.jpg)

In the third and final semi, Christian Malcolm of Team GB took the stage, racing alongside another fast Jamaican, Warren Weir. And this race was not without its share of the drama. In lane two Mathieu from the Bahamas false-started, quite significantly. His race was over, disqualified. He stood beneath us, dressed in blue, looking dejected, not quite sure what he’d done, or why he’d set off so early. The race re-started, and Malcolm came third, 20.51, behind Weir at 20.28\. Sadly not fast enough to qualify for the final.

Bolt went on to take the [200m gold medal](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18914449), in 19.32s, his season’s best and completing his double-double, the first man ever to retain both the 100m and the 200m. Blake and Weir came in second and third to take a Jamaican clean sweep. Total domination.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-103.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-103.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-105.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-105.jpg)

And the evening was just getting started. To the big events of the night, firstly, the [Women’s 400m Hurdles final](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18907733), at 20:45\. A vehicle and entourage drove around the track, perfectly placing hurdles every few metres, all very synchronised. Antyukh of Russia ran 52.70, a personal best, to take gold.

Next, another 200m race, this time the [Women’s 200m final](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18907742). We were excited to see Sanya Richards-Ross, an America that’d won the 400m, with her purple striped arm socks. Meanwhile we were rooting for the veteran Jamaican, Cambpell-Brown, her graceful interview after the semis warmed us to her. Once more the stadium hushed, the athletes took their marks and the race was started. Richards-Ross and Campbell-Brown fought it out, but only for 4th and 5th. Allyson Felix, a smaller woman with slick tied back hair, from the US, won gold, in 21.88s. She later went on to win gold in the Women’s 4x400m and 4x100m, in the latter smashing the long standing World record set way back in Munich.

The [Women’s long jump](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19189351) was drawing to a close, British hopeful Proctor not happy with her jump, she went out in the early stages. Reese from the US went on to win, with a jump of 7.12m. From our angle, with the women jumping towards us, it was hard to see the length of the jumps. But we had a good idea whether a jump was a foul or not.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-106.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-106.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-107.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-107.jpg)

The last big event of the night was the [Men’s 110m hurdles final](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19186672), we’d seen the semis earlier, and cheered Clarke on, as he narrowly qualified in the last spot available. For one last time, we cheered and whooped for Team GB, the flags swung high, everyone shouted, and we watched Clarke come in fourth, mightily impressive after coming in as the eighth fastest. Merritt from the US won gold with a time of 12.92s.

The crowds started to disperse, but we hung around a little longer, watching the Men’s decathlon 400m and the Women’s 100m hurdles victory ceremony. We soaked up the last of the Olympic atmosphere, our live sporting events had come to a close. It’d been phenomenal. Such a perfect, warm summer’s evening to enjoy these athletics.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-109.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-109.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-110.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-110.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-111.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-111.jpg)

In the crowds, queueing for Stratford station we bumped into some friends. And then the mad dash race to Victoria, our own urban triathlon, traversing train, escalator, tube and station at high speed, to make our train to Brighton with three minutes to spare. A suitably sporty, sweaty and exhausting end to it all.

After nine years, all it took was a local Olympic games to get Samantha interested in sport. From no interest at all, not even able to feign some semblance of passion for any sporting event, she became a sports fanatic, almost overnight, shouting at the TV, cheering athletes on. It was excellent and I hope she doesn’t return to her old ways after this.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/olympics-113.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/olympics-113.jpg)

<!--nextpage-->

There were four more days of Olympic games left, and we returned to watching the events from the comfort of our sofa, or at work in the office chair. We watched Usain Bolt win the 200m final, the Women’s 4x100m smash the world record and a frenchman win pole vault.

I caught the two BMX finals, each with their own share of calamity. I grew an interest in boxing, watching British guys and gals, jab, dodge and fight to our best boxing gold medal haul for 100 years. I even became passionate about Taekwondo, watching Jade Jones in her semi final and final bouts, superbly winning in two very close contests, only six minutes each, another fantastic unexpected gold for Team GB.

I streamed some fanciful synchronised swimming, impressed by our routine, but blown away by the Spanish. The final of the beach volleyball came down to the wire, with Germany winning; as too did the standard Volleyball, Russia winning at the last, coming back from a two set deficit and match point. The group sports all beginning to wrap up now. I watched the Basketball final, hoping Spain could defeat the US, of course it didn’t happen.

On Saturday morning we switched between mountain biking and rhythmic gymnastics and in the evening we marveled at Usain Bolt one last time, his last Olympic race? He, Yohan Blake and fellow Jamaicans smashed the 4x100m men’s relay record, making it six golds for Bolt.

Tom Daley then won a superb bronze in the 10m platform. And to cap-off the Team GB medal phenomena, a second, brilliant gold for Mo Farah in the 5000m. Wonderful.

Even the Sunday morning marathon was exciting, as people lined London’s streets to watch Kiprotich win impressively for Uganda, ahead of the Kenyan favourites. Time for one more medal? Go on then, a silver in the Women’s modern pentathlon, the last of over 300 Olympic events.

I suppose I should mention the closing ceremony too; Spice Girls, Pet Shop Boys, Muse and co. played us out with a slightly misguided music festival inside a paper maché London, not a patch on the opening ceremony, but equally quirky.

And that was that. Fireworks exploded and the Olympics were over. Two phenomenal weeks of sport, it felt like a national holiday, a two week break from reality. On Monday we would all raise our heads from a frenetic sporting schedule and return to the real world. But for now, we could celebrate, celebrate an awesome [Team GB medal toll](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/medals/countries/great-britain) — [29 golds, 17 Silvers and 19 Bronze](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19164612); celebrate a job well done — an enormous occasion executed with perfection, from the venues, the athletes, the volunteers and the transport network, it all just worked, flawlessly. And in the words of Lord Coe, “we did it right”.

We’re so glad we could have been part of it all, and feel privileged to have seen so many events. Simply unforgettable.
