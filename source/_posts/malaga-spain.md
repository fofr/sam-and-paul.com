## Travelling with a baby for the first time

{% figure malaga-cam-4.jpg landscape %}
Samantha, Paul and Conway – travelling with a baby for the first time.
{% endfigure %}

What were once the adventures of Samantha and Paul are now those of Samantha, Paul and Conway. Conway is our first child and at 3 months old this would be his first trip away, and our first with a baby. Being cautious we opted for something a bit more timid than our earlier adventures; a trip to southern Spain to see where Auntie Amanda lives.

We'd be gone for 10 days, a suitcase for the adults, and one for Conway – a baby must come with all his paraphernalia it seems. Clothes, nappies – reusable and disposable, toys, play mat, wipes, cotton wool, bottles and emergency formula, non-bio detergent tablets (apparently that's not a thing in Spain), changing mat, bath towel, swimwear, travel cot, cot sheets, muslins big and small, baby and room thermometer. A car seat forms part of the buggy and those two items were [free to check-in with EasyJet](http://www.easyjet.com/en/help/boarding-and-flying/flying-with-children).

We booked [an Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/12889501) (use our [invite link](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/c/paulh1525) for a discount – but also consider [the downside to Airbnb](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/12/profiteers-killing-airbnb-erode-communities)) so we’d have the freedom of a flat with all the amenities we’d need: a kitchen to stay in and cook when we’re too tired to go out, a washing machine for emergency laundry and reusable nappies and a sofa bed for Amanda to use when she stays over. It was a one bedroom in Pedregalejo, close to the beach and with a pool (albeit one too cold to use) and next to a bus stop for the 1, 3, 33 and 34 buses into Centro. It was also near to a large SuperSol supermarket.

## From Brighton to Malaga

We left Brighton in the midst of the “[Beast from the East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_cold_wave)”, a cold snap that saw widespread snow and temperatures well below zero. We were nervous, flights and trains had been cancelled, people were stuck in cars overnight, and for the first time in 8 years we’d had proper snow in Brighton.

At 7am we departed, wrapped up in winter layers, outside it was -5C, but with a wind chill that felt like -10C. Samantha pushed Conway while I lugged the laden suitcases along the snowy paths down to the station. The trains were running, and ours left and arrived on time. The flight was scheduled too, with no delays; at departures a queue of angry travellers waited by the EasyJet customer service desk, we were the lucky ones. As a family with a baby we went through our own security aisle at the airport and were allowed to skip the passenger queues for boarding. After the [plane was de-iced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deicing#Aircraft), a process that saw someone spray the wings with a high pressure fluid, we were up and on our way. Conway slept for most of the flight, and wasn’t bothered by takeoff or landing.

Amanda met us in Malaga, we boarded the train to the town centre, and then bus number 3 to Pedregalejo, less than an hour from landing and we were at our Airbnb. The sun was shining and the temperature pushed on 20C.

## Food at Kelucos

From out flat we were soon up and out again to find food. Along the Pedregalejo beach we found [Kelucos](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187438-d10592940-Reviews-Kelucos-Malaga_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html), or "orange chairs" as Samantha calls it. Inside Amanda found a friend, and we soon ordered _all the things_, beer, nachos and guac, various ham and cheese "pitufo" (a small crusty bread roll – not a Smurf), and [tomato bread](http://www.myrecipes.com/extracrispy/the-four-ingredient-spanish-breakfast-that-changed-my-life) (even though it wasn’t breakfast).

We bought some groceries, ate pizza and called it a night.

## All the rain

When we left for Malaga the forecast said rain all day all week. And while our arrival was greeted with sunshine, the blustery winds soon brought in the alluded to downpours. It rained and rained all day. Sister Amanda visited, so too did another of Sam’s friends and their family, who happened to also be in Malaga, and also happened to be called Amanda. While the rain poured outside we chilled with coffee and snacks, as their toddler twins went to town with Conway’s toys.

When friend Amanda left we set out for lunch, into the wind and rain, our first purchase was a much necessary umbrella. We then rushed along the seafront looking for somewhere to eat. The rain so heavy that at one point the promenade was impassable, a river had formed and we needed to go back up to the road and round.

Behind the plastic windows of [La Machina](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187438-d9738944-Reviews-La_Machina-Malaga_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html), where the wooden roof dripped and a small heater failed to stop the cold creeping in, we had lunch – burgers all round.

Going out on a day like this wasn’t worth it, we returned home, watched some Netflix (an Amazon firestick makes a good travel companion if you have TV and Wifi you can plug into) and had spaghetti bolognese for dinner.

Amanda and Samantha did make another excursion, to meet Amanda (the other one – confusing, isn’t it?), while I stayed at home. A good plan it seems, as with Sam navigating the sisters missed the house, then climbed all the way to the top of a steep hill, and got soaked through and through. Sam's boots didn't dry out for days and I found it all hilarious.

---

## Excursion into town

Still overcast, but with a break in the rain, me, Sam, Amanda and baby Conway took the bus into the centre. Of course Conway had decided that now would be a great time for him to poo all the time, and of course we didn’t bring enough nappies for this, nor enough changes of clothes. Following my emergency bus home and back again for supplies we made sure not to repeat that mistake. And while I did that, Sam bought new boots.

### El Pimpi

[El Pimpi](https://www.elpimpi.com/en/) is a Malagan institution, a sprawling restaurant alongside the Roman theatre and Gibralfaro castle walls. We found four separate entrances, with passages of bars and seats, and plenty of outdoor seating. We sat outside, watching the sparrows and pigeons fight for scraps amongst the pitter-patter of returning rain.

{% menu %}
* Ensaladilla Rusa: potato mayonnaise salad, mixed with prawns (Ensaladilla rusa con langostinos)
* Lightly-battered aubergine with sugarcane syrup dressing (Berenjenas fritas con miel de caña)

* Floresti (sweet wine & soda)
{% endmenu %}

{% figure malaga-34.jpg landscape %}

For the remainder of the day we sheltered at Amanda’s flat, where we slept, watched Snatch, some episodes of Friends and cooked stir fried rice, before ambling home in the damp around midnight.

## A sunny day in Malaga

Sunday brought us sunshine and warmth. Sam, Conway and I headed to Malaga port for a morning walk through Malaga park and out along the water. We met Amanda and boyfriend Mitch over coffee, crepes and croissants at the relaxing but slow-serviced “[smallCafe](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187438-d4077107-Reviews-Small_Cafe-Malaga_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html)”. Sparrows and pigeons nipped between our legs and ate crumbs of croissant, a large passenger ferry was moored besides the grandiose Malaga Port Authority and Conway slept in the shade of his buggy.

For lunch we welcomed more tapas and headed back towards the shopping precinct. Amanda brought us to a local restaurant, [Cortijo de Pepe](https://www.cortijodepepe.com/). Sat outside in the brick-lined alley, with waiters cooing at Conway, we devoured the best garlic prawns you could ever eat, and washed them down with cold San Miguel beer.

* Gambas al pil-pil (garlic prawns) x2

* Manchego cheese (Queso manchego)
{% endmenu %}

{% figure malaga-29.jpg landscape %}

With the sun still shining, and Brighton beating Arsenal in the football, the five of us searched for the hidden lift that takes you up to [Mount Gibralfaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibralfaro) and the lower level of the castle, [Alcazaba de Málaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcazaba_of_M%C3%A1laga).

After an emergency breastfeeding session in the shade besides the castle, we took the lift up to the top and showed Conway the sights. Carrying him, and avoiding taking the push chair through all the narrow paths and over all the bumps, we lifted him up to see the views, lowered him for a close-up of the butterflies and posed amongst the flowers; all the while other tourists stopped and smiled at us.

We rounded out the wonderfully warm day at Plaza de la Merced, sitting besides Picasso’s statue eating our ice-cream from waffle cones, a specialty by the heladería Nonna.

## Blustery promenade

One of the joys of being in an Airbnb is not fretting about missing a hotel breakfast. We arose late and left late, spending much of the morning either playing, feeding or nappy-changing our little boy. Morning rain gave way to rays of sun, so we ventured out again for a stroll along Pedregalejo Playa sometime after midday.

The waves lashed at the beach, the spray occasionally catching us. Seabirds drifted in the air as they battled the wind which kept throwing them off course. I was surprised by how shallow the beaches are, by how close the sea is to the restaurants, and by how much sea defence there was. Dotted between all the mini marinas lie shacks that sell €2 sardines cooked on open fire.

Half way along, then back again, we stopped at the upmarket looking [La Chancla Hotel](http://www.lachanclahotel.com/hotel-overview.html) for cocktails and a late lunch. They served us some very fine Caipirinha and Mojitos and the food was wonderful. The glass front kept in the warmth and kept out the gales, while other restaurants and patrons flapped about, napkins flying around.

* Chicken noodles
* Bravas

Amanda met us after work at our flat, we cooked fajitas and listened to music while Conway hiccuped at us with an incomparable cuteness, his little body flexing with shock at every little pop, then a coy smile and a look away as he feigns some sort of baby embarrassment.

---

## Massage and Marisqueria

Sam cooked us all a fine gallo pinto breakfast before she met Mitch for a massage and Amanda left for work, while I stayed at home with Conway – he slept most of the time, and it wasn't until I was on a full bus that he decided to arise from his slumber and wail at me. I swear he has his mother’s knack for timing.

Samantha met up with father and son at the port, and we stumbled on the high class [Marisqueria Godoy](http://www.marisqueriagodoy.com/) restaurant for lunch. We had the inside to ourselves on a Tuesday lunchtime, the owner sat at the bar with a child. We ate our iberico and fish croquettes with a glass of cava, and once Conway had a little feed and a nappy change, we finished up with the Godoy special; seafood and monkfish in a tomato sauce. All quite exquisite, we were relaxed and comfortable with our baby and fine dining.

{% figure malaga-godoy.jpg landscape %}

From the port we walked to the beginning of the beach then East along La Malagueta beach and back to Pedregalejo. About an hour’s walk, runners and cyclists passed us, families of stray cats darted in and about seafront rocks, and a cormorant bobbed on the sea waiting for a passing fish, the skies overcast once again.

## Scorching Pedregalejo

From hereon out the rain and wind was gone, there may have been an odd shower here or there but it didn’t affect us, we had sunshine and warmth and it felt like we were properly on vacation. Indeed there was so much sunshine there was even a little sunburn, my nose and arms turning red then swiftly brown.

Leaving in the morning glow we went to orange chairs Kelucos for a pitufo and coffee breakfast. We reclined in the chairs, watching the waves roll in and the palms sway lightly as Conway had his mid-morning nap, wearing his stylish cap to keep out the sun. Amanda met us here, and we proceeded along the seafront.

Amanda ate at La Galerna and chatted with Sam while I wandered the beach – partly to avoid all the outdoor smokers and partly to have some time to myself. I listened to music and watched the sea hug the shore. Soon enough we were off again, this time marching at pace, beyond El Palo to the end of the beach for Amanda to meet someone who’d be giving her (or not, as it turned out), a kettle and a lift.

{% figure malaga-13.jpg landscape %}

{% endfigure %}

At the end of the walk there is El Tintero, a place that’s meant to be good for seafood, but they had no shade and on inspection more staff than punters, we headed back again, making a poor stop at a place called Pontegordo where we had sardines, and beer served in a wine glass – always a warning sign. We left swiftly and stopped at our old favourite [La Chancla Hotel](http://www.lachanclahotel.com/hotel-overview.html) for a proper lunch.

{% menu %}
* Burger
* Club sandwich
* Caipirinha
* Mojito sin Alcohol
* Vanilla milkshake
* Decaff coffee
{% endmenu %}

That night Amanda joined Samantha and Conway at [Pez Tomillo](https://www.tuhogarfueradecasa.com/en/pez-tomillo/) for a tapas dinner while I watched Champions League football, as Tottenham lost to Juventus. Their evening was better than mine, and their oxtail and potato, soft-boiled tempura egg, iberian pork and tuna ceviche beat my nachos with a cheese more like mayo than melted.

---

With Amanda now at work, we took the opportunity to look around Malaga without a chaperone. In the glorious sunshine we pushed Conway through the tiled streets. Today was international women’s day, and a mass women’s strike was happening in the centre; though we couldn’t read the signs and didn’t understand their words we learnt the details only later when we Googled them.

Away from the chants in the square, we searched for a place to have churros, but besides the sprawling churros place, which was imminently closing, we found the quaint but cosmopolitan [Brunchit España](http://www.brunchit.es/).

At a little wooden table besides the window we devoured our delectable brunch:

{% menu %}
* Flat white x2
* AMERICAN WAFFLES: Artisan waffles with smoked bacon, tomato, melted mozzarella and avocado
* SUPER NORDIC: Artisan seeded bagel, smoked salmon, sweet apple and avocado with oven-baked baby potatoes
{% endmenu %}

{% figure malaga-11.jpg portrait %}

{% endfigure %}

With our bellies sated and Conway’s nappy and clothes clean, we ventured towards Castillo de Gibralfaro and the great hill that it sits upon. We gambled on being able to get up there with a buggy, and as we began our ascent we assumed that at some point the road would turn to steps and we’d need to stop.

The road winded, back and forth, snaking up the hill, the gradient steepening with each twist. I push Conway and our laden bags at a 45 degree angle up the hill, my head below the handle, my Converses offering little grip on the path. In hindsight this may not have been the best idea. But we persisted, and little by little we made it to the top. Of course there’s a bus that can bring you up to the top too, and we only discovered this afterward, but then where’s the adventure in that.

From the little kiosk we had cold soft drinks and ice cream, and talked about Malaga’s inclement weather with some Germans. It’s easy to make friends when you’re with a baby. The views out across the city, mountains, port and sea were astounding.

Refreshed, the sweat cleaned from our brows, we ventured to the castle’s entrance to find that the place couldn’t be navigated with a buggy, and it was too pricey to gamble. We returned the way we came, the downward journey a little more treacherous, one of us always standing in front of the other, ready to catch a runaway stroller should the worst happen.

On a small veranda with good views we discovered [El Ambigú de la Coracha](http://elambigudelacoracha.com/), an upmarket tapas restaurant, and as Conway was having his mid-afternoon nap we indulged.

{% menu %}
* Battered cod with smoked paprika (Bacalao bien rebozado orly de pimentón ahumado)
* Tuna tataki with avocado and wasabi (Tataky de atún con aguacate y wasabi)
* Roasted squid with arugula noodles and aioli (Calamar asado con fideos y alioli de rúcula)

There was a small descent and a herd of cats to navigate before we were at sea level. Out over the mountains heavy clouds formed which the low sun pierced through with burning rays. Without a telephoto lens and tripod we settled at Terraza el Balneario to watch the drama of sunset unfold over a sweet Malaga wine.

For our final day in Malaga we met up with Mitch and Amanda at Tejeringo's Coffee for the much discussed Spanish speciality, churros. Amidst the busy morning tables I held onto a table for 4 with the pram, while waiting for everyone else to arrive – with Sam in the loo the waitress kept returning to ask if more were coming.

Three churros each might have been one too many, my belly felt the way it does after you’ve eaten too much sugar. The dipping chocolate didn’t help.

{% figure malaga-6.jpg landscape %}

Samantha and Amanda spent some time together at the Turkish baths while I looked after Conway; we sat outside in the sunshine, sipping coffee and listening to live jazz at Placa de la Merced. Thankfully Conway’s poo-explosion and subsequent costume change happened just before they left me, cue a frantic but hilarious nappy change on a stone bench beneath some trees.

### El Pimpi

After the baths we regrouped and ate lunch at El Pimpi, sitting where we’d sat before.

{% menu %}
* Warm duck, confit pears and walnut salad (Ensalada templada de pato con peras confitadas y nueces)
* Homemade Spanish-style potato omelette (Tortilla de patatas de la casa)
* Seafood paella (Paella de “La Caleta”)
* Crispy breadcrumb parcel of iberian ham, loin of pork and melted cheese (Flamenquín ibérico jugoso con queso curado)
* Floresti (sweet wine & soda)
{% endmenu %}

### Pez Tomillo

This holiday really became one of enjoying as much great tapas as possible. After spending the afternoon packing while Amanda and Conway played, it was time for more awesome food. And so despite tapas at lunch, and with it being our last night, we ventured again to Pez Tomillo for _the best_ tapas in Malaga.

{% menu %}
* The best olives x2
* Andalusian croquettes with alioli
* Salmorejo – chilled tomato soup from cordoba
* Yakitori chicken with sautéed bulgur and Peruvian aji sauce
* Egg in its shell(slightly poached egg fried in tempura with mushroom and truffle oil sauce)
* Oxtail with chef’s special potato foam
* Tacos de cochinita pi-bil
* Manzanilla papirusa (sherry)
* Sauci Vermut (vermouth)
* Alhambra Roja (beer)
{% endmenu %}

Conway struggled to settle in the noisy Friday night restaurant, we took turns taking him outside to the quiet and dark water’s edge, through the plume of outside smokers.

That tapas was so good.

In the morning we returned to London. Bus, then a train and a flight – travelling with a baby seemed less daunting now, and we’d found time to relax and unwind in warmth, away from icy Britain. Of course having relatives nearby made it all the more easy, a perfect first step into travelling for our new family.
