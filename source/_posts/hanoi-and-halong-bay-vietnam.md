The sleeper from Dong Hoi to Hanoi took about 12 hours, we left at 11pm and got in at just past 11am. As first time sleeper train experiences go, it wasn't too bad. Sleep was of course interrupted, every time the train stopped you'd be jolted a little.

Coming into Hanoi we'd had our breakfast, for Sam that was a pot noodle, for me a giant apple; Sam read the Lonely Planet's guide to Hanoi, and I tried to relax with my white earphones and music.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Samantha reading about Hanoi on the sleeper train](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--002.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--002.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Samantha reading about Hanoi on the sleeper train</figcaption></figure>

Hanoi is known for its scam taxis; taxis with an insanely high meter rate, one that will treble before you've left the station. Lindsey, the girl we'd taken the Hoi An cooking course with, had exactly this problem; at 3am she'd arrived in Hanoi and her taxi tried to charge her extortionate rates. We were naturally paranoid, but needn't have worried; our hotel met us on the platform and led us through the busy station exit safely. “Taxi? You need a taxi? Taxi to your hotel?”, we must've said no a hundred times. We threw our heavy red and blue backpacks into the boot of the car and set off.

Hanoi is insane, that was my first impression. A busy, crazy place where motorcycles fight for their patch of road, mapping a weaving course to whatever destination they seek. Our taxi was slow, manoeuvring diligently through traffic, mopeds laden with goods kept streaming past. This place isn't designed for cars, though there's more here than we'd seen elsewhere.

We were staying at Charming Hotel, note, that's not Charming Hotel 2, that's the sequel. It's down Yen Thai St, a narrow alleyway for bikes only; a quintessential Hanoi side street teaming with life, it's own micro community amongst the craziness of the capital city. The hotel was nestled between some food stalls and a porcelain painting shop for kids.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Our modest room in Hanoi](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--001.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--001.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Our modest room in Hanoi</figcaption></figure>

Our room was modest, if a little old, it had the essentials — a toilet, a bed, wifi, breakfast, and we paid a little more for a room with a window, “city room” it was called. The staff were lovely and always wanting to help, a team always waiting in the lobby.

We slept, showered, sorted our laundry and headed into Hanoi for the afternoon. We were in the old quarter, a short walk from the sights, the restaurants and the plethora of shops.

The shops are small, thin and narrow again like most of the houses (see: obscure government tax on building width). Outside is usually a patch of sidewalk, it would be wrong to let this go to waste; business in Hanoi takes place on the street — food stalls, shoe repairs, metal work. The path is valuable workspace and the shop is for storage. Busy streets are oozing with the working life of the Hanoians.

We set out to follow the Lonely Planet walking tour, which started by Hanoi's renowned Hoan Kiem lake, though we got sidetracked. For almost an hour, strolling through the streets and around the lake no one hassled us. A first. Was everyone sleeping? A lovely teenage girl did stop and say hello to us by the lake, I was being all defensive, but she was genuinely practicing her English, the sales pitch never came and she wished us a pleasant holiday. When we mentioned Halong Bay her eyes lit up, she had some prepared sentences ready.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Samantha on Hoan Kiem lake](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--004.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--004.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Samantha on Hoan Kiem lake</figcaption></figure>

Standing at the foot of the lake, Sam shared with me the story of Cu Rua, the lake's legendary giant turtle. Cu Rua is the last surviving lake turtle, a mere 200kg, 2m long and 100 years old. Locals believe the turtle to be sacred; he is one of only three of this freshwater turtle species left. He wasn't coming out to see us today.

To the north of the lake, on an island, sits Ngoc Son temple, reached by an arching red wooden bridge. Beneath lanterns hanging from an ornate wooden roof men played mahjong. Inside, beyond the plastic fruit and standard temple dedication affairs, lies a bronze plated stuffed turtle, one of Hanoi's ancient turtles. Outside a couple played badminton by the Martyr's Monument, a dedication to those that died for Vietnam's independence.

Diversion complete, we set about the Lonely Planet walking tour. Old quarter street names are self descriptive, Hang Bong — cotton street, Hang Giay — shoe street, and so on. The streets have diversified a little now, but their original flavour is plain to see. Along shoe street people sold and mended shoes, and children carrying thread hassle you, suggesting your perfectly good sandals need fixing.

We crossed the road back and forth a few times, quickly becoming masters of the Vietnam road crossing game (of life and death). The walking tour devolved into a tour of variously named shopping streets and ultimately a shopping trip we weren't ready for. We abandoned it, booked tickets for the water puppet theatre and nipped back to our nearby hotel.

At 6:30pm we were back at the water puppet theatre for a performance described by the Lonely Planet as, “Punch and Judy in a pool”. Water puppetry, or roi nuoc, is a traditional art form dating back a thousand years, emerging from flooded rice paddies. Set against live traditional music, puppets move about the water surface, controlled by hidden poles in murky water. Sam enjoyed the hour long show, but I couldn't find the appeal, it wasn't particularly graceful.

In night time Hanoi we meandered towards Madame Hien, housed in an old villa and specialising in elegant street food. Sam opted for the five course taster menu. My soft-shelled crab starter, as might be expected, was delicious.

Up early, we breakfasted and were on a minibus heading for Halong Bay by 8am. We left half our luggage at the hotel, we were going on the Indochina three day two night trip. The minibus journey from Hanoi to Halong Bay is a bumpy boring four hour trek. En route we picked up Germans Isabelle and Manuel, and Richard and Rochelle from Australia; two couples we'd spend the next three days with.

At the midpoint, two hours in, there's an obligatory toilet stop, amongst a touristy service station complete with disabled textiles workshop and huge expensive stone carvings available for international shipping. There's various other Vietnam souvenirs too. Surely a commission deal going on here.

Passing through the industrial zone of Haiphong, we filled the time talking about University, education systems and all those grand national systems that differ from country to country. We passed large Foxconn and Canon electronics factories and in the distance limestone karsts were rising from the horizon.

The Indochina port is slightly beyond Halong, and to reach it you cross a modern suspension bridge that divulges gorgeous views of the bay. This place is something otherworldly.

We chose Indochina based on its positive trip advisor reviews and promised quietness in an area of the bay away from the hundreds of other tourist junks. Its exclusivity in the bay and high quality comes at a price. The duration of the trip was also difficult to decide; one night, two nights? The trip from Hanoi is so arduous we opted for a longer time on the boat.

At the port we met the third and final couple to join us, Richard and Sue, from the UK but more immediately from a trip to Hong Kong. And of course our guide for the duration, “Ha”, “as in ha ha ha”, he told us. He asked for our dietary requirements, “no cat or dog?”, awkward sense of humour this guy has.

He led us to our boat. The beautiful wooden boat with great red sails, as seen on the website, is no more. A government decree has forced all tourist boats to be painted white, and now they all look the same. Our boat is the Prince III, III for 3day2night, that's one word in Ha's vocabulary. It's a large wooden affair, with four double rooms, a mast, an upper deck, some sun loungers and a bar area.

At the bar we sit down, sip our complimentary cocktails and listen to Ha's introduction. He introduces the staff; a barman, chef, waiter, captain and engineer — they enter in procession, clapping loudly. Our captain speaks to us in Vietnamese, he wishes us a happy time on board.

The boat raises anchor and we're off, Ha points to the map and shows us where we're heading; an hour or so journey south east, to Bai Tu Long.

We were in room two, and our key was adorned with a large wooden dolphin. From the narrow corridor we entered, we had a double bed with beautiful Vietnamese linen (which we then tried to find and buy in Hanoi, but without much luck), storage cupboards, air conditioning and two windows that look out across the bay. We even had a private bathroom, with shower. Sam was most excited about the bathroom porthole, “it's a proper porthole, it even opens”.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Samantha in our room, on the Prince III](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--016.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--016.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Samantha in our room, on the Prince III</figcaption></figure>

Time for lunch, and we gathered in the bar area. Food, all inclusive, was served on shared platters; chicken, cucumber and sesame salad, huge king prawns, pippis with chilli, and so on. All very tasty and plentiful. Halida beer was our preferred drinks choice, and, at times, it was drunk so fast the cans stopped being chilled.

We sailed for about an hour, on calm waters, the sky a little overcast. We sat up top on wooden outdoor furniture, and with my iPad I wrote about our cave trip. Trekking through a cave is notoriously difficult to describe. This was perfectly relaxing, no cares in the world, a beautiful changing landscape and a cool breeze. Limestone peaks would pass by, occasionally revealing, through a small peek hole, a secret lagoon. There were remnants of caves too, and huge outdoor stalactites. The waves brushed against the foot of the peaks, gently eroding them, and cutting away at the bottom, so as to leave them leaning precariously.

Soon there were no other boats in sight, and the mainland was hidden from us. Just the gentle chug of the boat, splashing of the waves, a few coves and bays and the occasional tiny deserted beach.

Time for a little physical exertion, and another opportunity to go kayaking. In our swim wear we climbed down the side of the boat, into our orange kayak, me in front and Sam at the rear. With our two ended oars we set off. We think we know how to do this … though actually we don't. But we remain civil, avoid arguments and Ha explains how to steer and maintain momentum.

The route took us out and around H. Cap La. South east, then north, towards the open sea, and back around, along the edges of H. Ran. As inefficient as we were, our arms ached and, apart from the odd collision, mostly watched the group from behind. We stopped to watch a large Oriental Pied Hornbill in the treetops, as he danced about the foliage. We continued around to the boat, manoeuvred into position and made it in the end, about an hour of kayaking all in all, and quite enough for me.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Kayaking around H.

Cap La</figcaption></figure>

We anchored there for the night, relaxed and prepared for dinner on the top deck, with Sam in her newly bought oriental Hoi An dress. More prawns and chicken salad; the differences between meals were subtle, but tasty nonetheless. I washed it down with a black russian cocktail.

A storm was rumbling out in the distance, and the night sky, black and cloudy without an orange hue, would light up with each burst of lightning. Young Richard, or more, younger Richard, the fireman, attempted to photograph this, but a rocking boat does not make a good tripod.

With Richard and Rochelle we saw out the night with a game of hearts and some Halida beers. Sam managed to get the highest score possible, 125, very impressive, though she was none too happy.

I'm not entirely sure how I did this, but at 5:30am I accidentally woke up, rolled over and looked out at the most amazing sun rise across the bay. The purple and orange sky reflected in the sea, against the silhouettes of the towering rocks. Beautiful, I watched, struggled to focus my eyes, strained to take a couple of pictures and fell back asleep. Dreamy.

At 8am we had breakfast. A lovely chicken pho followed by fried eggs and toast. Yummy. From the bay we headed south, to Vung Vieng fishing village, an hours journey. We passed the time by relaxing, I wrote by the bar, and Sam spoke to Ha about his family, and the many days he spends away from them. Above us Black Kites swooped, looking for their next prey. The mountains quietly rolled by, elegant and serene. Blissful, unavoidable relaxation.

At the fishing village we clambered onto the blue boat we tow everywhere and were ported to a small harbour. Two by two we boarded our own wooden row boats with hat adorning rower. No physical exertion required today.

The village resides within a natural bay, sheltered in all directions from strong sea winds and whatever tropical storm might come their way. Houses, which looked fairly new, were turquoise wooden shacks with orange metal rooftops, tied together on floating blue barrels. They were mostly one room, the odd couple had an annex, all with a wooden boat parked out front. Washing was hung outside, an old Manchester United top billowed in the breeze. Each house had its own TV aerial and a CRT television, though I couldn't fathom where the power came from. The Vietnamese flag flew proudly from their rooftops, as it also did from our boat's mast.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Exploring a fishing village by row boat](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--033.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--033.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Exploring a fishing village by row boat</figcaption></figure>

Ha showed us that they keep pet dogs, dogs they respect (and don't eat!), though they seemed to be running around on small floating platforms and we wondered how they'd get any exercise.

We docked in the centre of town; some fisheries, a school, a small hall cum museum. The fish are grown and sold for profit. At the school the kids were out for lunch. Next to the blackboard was a Ho Chi Minh portrait, and a donation box hung outside. The museum outlined their sea dwelling culture and history. Much smaller and very different to the floating villages we saw in Phuket; quaint and rather lovely.

Back on the row boat we left the village, to visit a stupendous limestone arch at Hon Vung Ha. A picture perfect paradise. We circled this ancient passageway and finished our circuit with a stop at an oyster farm.

A smartly dressed guide greeted us and explained how they grow and farm pearls. We watched closely as a girl plied open an oyster, held it open with clamps and inserted a small impurity and ball, before closing it up again. These seeded oysters are left for many years, 30% will yield a pearl, but only 10% will yield one good enough to sell. The girl with the tweezers and clamps seeds up to 600 oysters per day. From one end of the process to the other, a two year old oyster was waiting to be opened. We again watched as this oyster was prised open, as tweezers hunted about the gooey entrails a glistening silver pearl emerged. But it wasn't perfectly spherical, and the colour was inconsistent, it couldn't be sold she told us. The workshop backed onto a shop, complete with earrings, bracelets, necklaces and so on.

We tipped our rowers and returned to our big white boat on the sea. Our next stop was to the North East, Thienh Can Son cave, for a deserted beachside barbecue. The clouds parted to reveal a deep blue sky, the sunshine had arrived and the temperatures soared. At the back of the boat we made the most of the sun recliners; Sam with her based-in-Vietnam book, “Over the moat”, and a cool can of lychee juice. Limestone peaks continued to roll by.

At our beach, a thin strip of sand beneath a towering rock, parasols and tables were waiting. As our crew cooked lunch, we swum in the warm shallow sea, and bathed on the soft pure sand. More unadulterated relaxation. I picked up hermit crabs with my feet, explored nearby rock pools, and discovered a tower of discarded oyster shells. We were on this beach for hours, a shower and change of clothes just over there on our boat, no cares in the world.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Samantha and our boat, on our deserted island](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--044.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--044.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Samantha and our boat, on our deserted island</figcaption></figure>

Lunch beckoned, lovely grilled king prawns, beef, pork and chicken, and washed down with cold Halida lager. To walk off our food we trekked up the hill, following a steep path to the Thienh Can Son cave entrance. Yes, another cave on our holiday, you might mistakenly think we're some sort of cave fanatic. I expected a small cavern, but it opened out into many rooms, rooms a family had once lived in. They'd been evicted by the government, Ha explained, no doubt to make way for bumbling tourists like us, though Ha said it was because they'd damaged the cave.

On the beach once more, and another opportunity to go kayaking. I passed it up, so Sam rowed off into the distance with Ha, and I slept on the beach. A lap around the nearby island, with a guide to do all the hard work. Our crew had their downtime, and I watched them play football on the sand with oars setup as goal posts.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Samantha and Ha, returning from their short kayaking trip](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--058.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--058.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Samantha and Ha, returning from their short kayaking trip</figcaption></figure>

A few other boats started to arrive at “our beach”, as we dubbed it. And in the distance a storm was brewing. Time to go then; but not before a swimming race back to the boat. Because of the storm, and chance of some rough winds, we returned to the sheltered bay we'd stopped at the night before, and anchored for the evening.

Our final evening meal was served in the bar, and amidst the usual salads and prawns the crew brought out intricately carved food; two storks dancing on potatoes, a rose carved into a butternut squash, and a replica of our boat made from a watermelon and carrots, sails and all. Our chef gave us a demonstration too, and from the narrow corridor he flambeed prawns amidst a cloud of steam.

This was almost the end of our short trip, and our crew came to say their thank yous, even singing for us; apparently a song from a popular Vietnamese talent show. Ha asked if we could sing something back, but we failed to find a song, and the moment descended into awkwardness.

To round out the night we sat up top with some drinks and shared music, taking turns to plug iPhones into a set of portable speakers. The bay was quiet and dark, with only the gentle noise of waves stroking the rocks, and the light of boats anchored nearby. From the speakers we played Sigur Ros, Eddie Vedder and Birdy and I found that old Richard had fantastic taste. A lovely evening, I didn't want it to end.

Knowing the time that dawn would happen, Sam set an alarm to wake us at 5:20am. I can't say I was too happy about this, but the sunrise was simply spectacular. Sam got dressed and took the camera out to get some shots. I merely rolled over and watched from my bed, capturing stills with my phone. The orange, red and purple was deeper than before, and the more I watched the better it became.

I'm not a morning person, especially this early, and I was soon fast asleep again. But at 7am Sam was up and out, taking a morning swim around the boat. Breakfast this morning was lighter, and without my staple pho. We talked about dawn with the other couples, none of them had seen it, some had woken at 6am and deemed, “no sunrise this morning”, but were astounded when they saw our pictures.

Our itinerary was short; we were headed back to the harbour for midday. We tidied our rooms, checked out and settled our drinks bills, with one last meal ordered a la carte. We had a few last moments to relax and take in the scenery of Bai Tu Long bay, although today the rain was lashing down and it really was dreary.

Once more, we had an opportunity to thank our crew (and tip them), and then it was time to go. We donned complimentary ponchos and clambered aboard the small blue boat in the rain, with its wet plastic seats, and chugged slowly over to the jetty where our trip really did end. We said our goodbyes and boarded the mini bus for the 4 hour long, arduous journey back to Hanoi.

The trip back felt bumpier and longer than before, and the tourist shop was less exciting. Richard and Rochelle were continuing on to Laos, and on the bus we talked with Manuel and Isabelle about their remaining time in Vietnam, passing on valuable Hoi An tips.

We were back in Hanoi and our “Charming Hotel” by 4pm. We were very lucky to have sunshine on our trip amidst Hanoi's overcast rainy season, in which many a trip can be cancelled. Even beneath the clouds it's still a sweltering 30C.

With the better part of the day now gone, we sorted ourselves out and headed for dinner. We booked a table at Ly Club, a Lonely Planet recommended restaurant in the French quarter, and nervously took a taxi there; aware of the potential for overcharging.

Ly Club is housed in a decadent colonial style building. The walls were a warm orange with photos of historic Hanoi. Our reservation was entirely unnecessary, as per usual, the restaurant was empty, but for a couple of westerners at the far table. On a Saturday we expected things to be a little more hectic. In these beautiful surroundings, and with pricey menus, our food expectations were very high.

The opening cocktails were scrumptious. A far east caipirinha made with sake, lemongrass, chilli, rum, lime, mojito syrup and wine. A subtle spiciness, and a thoroughly lovely drink; although Sam ordered another later and it didn't quite have that necessary balance. The Innovative Mojito was also good.

Sam's desire to eat soft shelled crab was thwarted again, as the starter was unavailable. An apple, scallop and vermicelli fried cake was a tasty alternative, and I tucked into a clam and lemongrass concoction. For mains I devoured a huge fried Red Snapper fish (deboned for me on Sam's request), but it was garnished with a very bitter fresh herb and lacked any sauces. Samantha had a crab and vermicelli noodle main, which she enjoyed.

All in all the food was good, but it didn't quite meet the standards we expected, or the price tag. We asked the restaurant to call us a taxi home, and we were whisked through Saturday night Hanoi, past the lake and many dressed up and scantily clad Hanoians out for the night. But we called it a night, and quickly fell asleep at our hotel. I left the iPad open on the desk, connected to the wifi it was ever so slowly backing up our recent swathe of Vietnam pictures.

We awoke early again, ready to make the most of our only full day in Hanoi. First stop would be the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum, which closes at 11am every morning. Shorts aren't allowed, and Sam had to cover her shoulders. After breakfast we rushed out and took a taxi to Ba Dinh square.

We wandered slowly towards the cuboid, marble mausoleum, along the wide pedestrianised street. Everyone was standing outside the monolith, there were no queues, and no one was going in. Was it closed? Two guards in brilliant white stood motionless at the entrance. A guide explained. Turns out Uncle Ho, as he is called, was on his annual holiday to Russia for re-embalming, and he wouldn't be back 'til October. Balls.

The Lonely Planet described what we were missing. Even a Google Image search doesn't reveal anything, as photos aren't allowed.

The mausoleum is meant to be lotus shaped, and I can see how that might be the case, but its rigid cuboid marbleness dominates, resembling the mausoleums of other famous communists; most notably Lenin. And this was all against his desires to have a simple cremation.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Ho Chi Minh](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--075.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--075.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum</figcaption></figure>

At least that wasn't all there was to do here. Instead we visited the Ho Chi Minh museum, via the “One Pillar Pagoda” (built in 1054 but destroyed by the French in 1954 and subsequently rebuilt). The museum itself is a grand affair, a bold white edifice that oozes communism; engraved with the hammer and sickle and flying the Vietnamese flag proudly.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--portrait">[![Ho Chi Minh museum](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--081.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--081.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Ho Chi Minh museum</figcaption></figure>

Inside we checked our bags through security and began looking around. The first exhibit was a temporary one and it showcased modern Vietnam and Laos relations. Hmm, everything is in Vietnamese, who are these people? Perhaps we need a guide. We enquired, and waited 20 minutes for an English speaking guide, and then gave up. Luckily enough, beyond the first floor, the main body of the museum is in English too.

In the foyer a bronze Ho Chi Minh statue greeted us. An elderly guy, led by what I presume were his sons, jostled to stand proudly beneath it and have his photo taken. The museum is circular, and we quietly wandered in a clockwise direction learning about Ho Chi Minh's early life, his many names, his many guises, his imprisonments and the following appeals in Hong Kong. Many copies of his letters are on show, and the stirring appeal to the Vietnamese people, written in English, was a fascinating read. “To the revolution…” it begun. Powerful, forceful writing in one of the five languages he could speak.

Exhibits included samples from his cave dwelling where the revolution was devised and extracts from his prison diary. As we wander around, he grows up, becomes prominent, overthrows the French, unites the country, and begins the fight against the American invasion, dying before he could see his country united once more. It reminded me of earlier discussions about the war in Phong Nha and a suggestion that the Americans had fought idealistically against communism, whilst the Vietnamese fought for nationalism.

The botanical gardens outside the complex are lovely, with Ho Chi Minh's former residence nestling in the trees. We rested amongst the flowers in the peaceful park before embracing the onslaught of Hanoi streets once more. We walked along Chu Van An and P Van Mieu towards the temple of literature, expertly dodging the angry student attempting to sell us things.

Lunch time! We stopped at the excellent and highly recommended KOTO restaurant. Know oneself, teach oneself, its motto proudly says. It's a not-for-profit business that helps disadvantaged young people learn the restaurant trade. And the staff were lovely; a new trainee practicing her English read us the specials, stumbling on the word “Chardonnay”.

It's a four storey building with lime green walls, downstairs there's a delicatessen and souvenir shop at the back. Their recipe book was especially good. Too heavy to buy here, we bought it online and made a donation.

Did I mention the food yet? Well, I should have, because it's fantastic. Some of the best food we had in all of Vietnam. Smoothies and iced coffee accompanied stir fried duck and Sam's scrumptious bamboo beef, a meal she still hasn't stopped raving about. For dessert the mango cheeses (sic) cake was too eye-catching to pass up.

Leaving the air-conditioned haven of KOTO, we once again embraced Hanoi's streets, tuk-tuk touts and souvenir sellers in the mid afternoon heat. Our unguided tour continued with a visit to the Temple of Literature, practically free to get in. In my head I imagined large decadent halls filled with rows of books. I was wrong; instead we were greeted with gardens and temples and preserved traditional architecture centuries old.

From the great portico, we appeared within an enclosed garden. To the left and right were ponds bearing lotus plants, and brilliant complicated topiary, guarded with ugly red tape. Beneath the first covered building we hid from the sun, already sweltering, the sweat running down my back. A placard explained the history of this ancient Vietnamese architecture. It all remind me very much of the Hue citadel.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Dragons at the Temple of Literature](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--087.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--087.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Dragons at the Temple of Literature</figcaption></figure>

Beyond lay another garden, and through another the Khue Van pavilion was a large pond, surrounded by 82 stelae, each different and dedicated to an early scholar. What's a stelae? In this case it's a large stone slab with Chinese text, sitting atop a tortoise, one of Vietnam's holy creatures; they show everlasting respect to talent. Around the pond were well tended flowers, where tiny birds played.

In another courtyard rooms were now souvenir shops, and a red roofed temple housed a bronze stork and tortoise. Beautiful Vietnamese girls in fantastic dresses wandered about the temples, closely followed by their photographers, and watched by crooning old men. No doubt the photos were for a special occasion, but only a couple were obviously weddings. Hidden alleyways on the left and right led the way to the final temple.

This two floored temple was filled with the sounds of traditional music, and upstairs three statues of former kings basked in red light. Our favourite aspect? The huge fans that kept us cool, and momentarily stopped the hot sweats. Subtly, trying to remain respectful, I directed the cool breeze up my shirt. Ahh, bliss.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Keeping cool by the fan](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--094.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--094.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Keeping cool by the fan</figcaption></figure>

From the temple we walked back towards our hotel. We wanted to find the duvet we'd seen on our boat trip, and stopped at whatever fabric shop we spotted along the way. The shopkeepers were all eager to make a sell, and happy to help, but none had what we were looking for.

We got lost a couple of times, navigating the labyrinthine streets with GPS and Google Maps. Though, by now, we were crossing Hanoi's busy roads like experts, the heavy traffic effortlessly swarmed around us, scooters weaving by our moving obstacle, as if this was some sort of social aerodynamics experiment. We were steadfast, calm and successful.

After all that walking and traffic dodging we rewarded ourselves with another stop at our favourite Hanoi coffee shop, Joma. A quick drinks and cake stop, and a bit of free wifi internetting from the comfort of leather sofas.

Eager for more shopping, we found Hanoi's night market, a single long street filled with souvenir stalls and clothes. Not a patch on the Chiang Mai night market mind. Tomorrow was our final day in Vietnam, of course we should buy things! Table runners, placemats, lacquer drink mats, and even six cups and saucers with tea pot as part of an oriental tea set – with a free bamboo tray. Normally we'd attempt to haggle, but the price they asked for I was very happy to pay, a mere £6\. It felt like a good deal, and probably made up for all those countless other occasions where we were overcharged by an incalculable margin. Price tags, such a wonderful invention. I have a new appreciation for UK trade laws.

I left Sam to do a little more shopping while I sought a restaurant for dinner. We chose Green Mango, small, chic and clearly only frequented by foreigners. A guard sat outside. I downed a whisky and honey cocktail waiting for Sam to arrive. My meal was fairly average, but Sam loved her spring rolls. With my carbonara pizza in a doggy bag, we called it a night.

As might be expected, most of the morning was spent packing. Sam worked her magical packing skills to fit all our latest purchases into our bags, which I'd believed to be already full! Our taxi to the airport was at 3pm; we asked for a late checkout, skipped breakfast and set about town one last time.

We used the Lonely Planet's coffee suggestions to find a hidden coffee shop, Cafe Pho Co. Along 'linen street', through a linen shop, out the back into a courtyard, it felt like we were intruding on someone's home; it probably was someone's home, but we certainly weren't intruding. A four storey apartment, certain parts were dedicated to the cafe. Just as we looked lost a girl approached us with a menu, we ordered and she motioned for us to go up the stairs. Two flights of stairs, and a metal spiral staircase later, we were sitting on traditional blue plastic seats with views out across Hoam Kiem lake. Sam bravely ordered an egg white coffee, which was interesting, but not my cup of tea. Pun intended.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Coffee at Cafe Pho Co, egg white coffee on the left](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hanoi-halong-bay--099.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hanoi-halong-bay--099.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Coffee at Cafe Pho Co, egg white coffee on the left</figcaption></figure>

We were still on the lookout for the duvet cover we'd seen on our boat, and linen street seemed like a good place to look. We left many a shopkeeper believing they were about to make a sale, but nothing was quite right.

Still hungry for food, we stopped at our favourite Joma for a drink and snack. I devoured a tuna melt and tried the interesting 'London fog' tea, earl grey with vanilla. Alas, Sam didn't want to rest and do nothing. We had more things to buy!

Shopping once more, we found chopsticks and a box, another table runner, and some quite excellent Vietnamese propaganda posters, “Vietnam — the hidden charm” one proclaims. Our final stop was Huong Mai, a coffee store with twenty varieties of coffee bean in plastic tubs, like a children's sweet shop. Over the course of an hour we tried four different beans and left with bags of Culi, Moka and Kopi Lumak (Weasel coffee).

At the hotel we packed our new purchases, with Mary Poppins like abilities, donned our walking boots for the flight and took the 3pm taxi to Hanoi airport. Goodbye crazy motorcyclists, crazy roads, frenetic Hanoi, charming Vietnam; you've been phenomenal.
