The first leg of our Malaysia and Borneo tour began in Kuala Lumpur (KL), at the upmarket Traders hotel. It’s in the centre of town, 40 minutes from the airport, and with probably the best views of the Petronas Towers. Buildings in KL go straight up; condominiums, skyscrapers, office blocks, most buildings must be over 20 floors. Our hotel was no exception, and our room was on the 29th floor.

Jet-lagged and exhausted we’d checked in late the night before, just awake enough to be astonished by our [perfect nighttime cityscape](http://instagram.com/p/lkbDlXNFC8/ "Instagram"). When we opened the curtains the next morning [we could barely see them](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/kuala-lumpur-003.jpg "Foggy towers"), thick fog and rain made a day of slumber our best choice. We were however up in time for breakfast at 10:30am, the buffet was large but expensive, and with so many options in town we only had breakfast here once. My highlight was a Chinese noodle soup in a rich chicken broth, but there was sushi and fried rice, fresh fruit and pastries too.

Being Sunday, and being exhausted, we chose to make the most of our pricey luxurious hotel. On the roof there’s a covered pool and sky bar, once more with views over KL City Park, the Petronas twins and the surrounding towers. We nestled down by the windows, amongst the red sofas and read our Lonely Planet guide. For lunch, from the Skybar, we had a Sam and Paul holiday classic, soft-shelled crab.

Our relaxation was interrupted by mild camera panic, some photos were showing visible signs of dust on the sensor, and we marched off to a camera store in one of KL’s many malls. The shop couldn’t help, but it didn’t matter much, it’s only visible in certain bright images, and the camera at least works. Inside the brightly-lit multi-storey shopping centre we stood in dumb-awe, “Is this Asia? It feels like London. Look it’s the same brands. We could be anywhere. Let’s get out of here”.

Being in Malaysia one week after the MH370 plane disappearance was profound. Everywhere people were glued to TVs and radios, waiting for the next announcement from the prime minister. Taxi drivers had little TVs, and big screens blasted out the news. Where was it? What had happened to the plane? Everyone in Malaysia was keen to find out. Radio DJs read out “Pray for MH370” messages, and outside malls were large prayer walls, with heartfelt letters and prayers of safe return. Purple ribbons symbolised the disaster, and the news events remained with us throughout our holiday.

The weather brightened a bit by the afternoon, and we walked back to Traders via the Petronas towers and another mall. It turned out that perhaps today wasn’t the best day to relax and do nothing, as our only other day, a Monday, everything would be closed. Nevermind, it’s a kind of forceful relaxation. KL is much the concrete jungle, its recent development, widespread construction and faceless modernness suck out whatever character it might have had. It’s probably a great place to live, or do business, but as a holiday destination it’s best as a short stop over. That suited us just fine.

That night, based on reviews and the Lonely Planet, we took a taxi to the observation tower and the revolving Atmosphere 360 restaurant. Until we got there I hadn’t realised it was a buffet, an expensive one at that. The base of the tower is surrounded by kitschy tourist booths, like a mini theme park with a single attraction. Upstairs there’s lurid purple mood lighting and a tacky star-theme going on, but if you can get past that to the windows the view is astonishing. Unobstructed in all directions, its perfect for a spot of twilight photography (if you’ve brought a tripod and you don’t mind your table and food moving away from you as you snap your long exposure).

I was in a foul mood most of the night and didn’t think the food was worth the price. Samantha made the most of her buffet (and my awful company), and enjoyed the seafood, stews, rice and so on. Perhaps it was the jet lag and lack of sleep getting to me? Yeah, I’ll go with that, definitely.

My mood lightened as soon as we left the ‘revolvaurant’, and the slow walk back via the towers and park was more romantic. The mall was still open, and despite it being 10pm, the park was alive with people. By the lake we saw a long-tailed mammal scarper up a tree, it looked a bit like an otter or a marten, but my online searches haven’t revealed what’s usually seen in the park, or what city wildlife lives in KL.

Sunday night at the Traders Skybar was too clubby-wubby for us tonight, so we called it a day.

With a breakfast snack from a kiosk outside Traders, we took a taxi to KL Bird Park, one of the few attractions that opens on a Monday. We’re not keen on seeing caged animals, but for the most part the park is free-flying and expansive, and it would be good practice at photographing wildlife before going into the jungle. We paid the fee and put on the orange wristband. The sun was out too, and out of the shade it was really very hot.

Inside small egrets (some red), storks, crowned-pigeons, parrots and peacocks fly (or walk) around. There’s a flamingo section, some cages containing a few eagles and owls, an indoor parrot shed, some pens with emus, ostriches and the dinosaur like Australian cassowary, and a free-flying hornbill area near the exit. It’s inevitable that a bird will shit on you, or your bag, or both.

Using auto-focus on the F4 zoom lens meant the eyes of the birds were often out of focus, and switching to manual was fiddly, but gave significantly better results, provided the bird hung around long enough. The practice was welcome, the 200mm lens was still new to us both.

After a few hours with the birds we stopped for lunch at the Hornbill Cafe, an impressive little place with really good food. This was our first opportunity to have Nasi Lemak and Nasi Goreng, and the fried chicken Samantha ate here was the best she had in all of Malaysia. We’d advise against sitting outside though, as you finish your meal the egrets with their pointy beaks know you’re nearly done and begin to encroach. If you walk away before your plates are taken there’ll be an unsightly bird melee, chicken bones and rice will be flung over the terrace. We definitely didn’t do that, and we didn’t run away either.

Just as we boarded the rundown taxi (it was a poor old green thing, lovingly kept together with sticky tape) it began raining. Not too bothered about doing much, or seeing much (very unlike us), we spent the rest of our afternoon in the hotel’s Skybar on floor 33\. That meant a lot of swimming and lounging about with fabulous views. With everything else being shut, or wet, the comfy red sofas and cocktails kept us entertained until dinner.

At dusk I tried putting up a tripod to capture the Petronas towers – just as the sun sets and the lights come on (“magic time”). Apparently that’s not allowed, something about licensing a waiter said, probably just a pool-bar ambience thing. I settled with resting it sideways on a well positioned ash-tray, balanced on a window ledge, that did the job. We thought about venturing out for dinner, but the reviews for “Upstairs at Gobo”, part of Traders, were all positive, we took the easy option and stayed in. Our booking was quite late, 9pm, so we hung about the Skybar a little longer, where they make a very good caipirinha (once you’ve convinced the waiter, and your wife, that you did see it on the menu, and it is available).

Smart casual, business savvy Gobo Upstairs was quiet when we arrived, but for a long table of conference delegates; something about international obesity. Through the glass ceiling and the large windows the twinkles of Kuala Lumpur’s towering lights shone in, giving the restaurant a prestigious ambiance. The bread basket included freshly made charcoal bread, something we hadn’t ever seen before, but given how much we saw it again it must be popular in Malaysia — it’s not burnt, and it tasted just like any other bread, but it’s black through. The menu was split into land and sea dishes, we had one from each. It was the fine dining experience we were looking for, everything was cooked exquisitely.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   grilled black angus tenderloin with king prawn (truffle mashed potato, braised asparagus and bordelaise sauce)
*   crispy skin sea bass with orange butter sauce and truffle mashed potato
*   bread and butter pudding

Our last night in KL before [flying south to Kuching](/2014/05/kuching-borneo/ "Kuching, Borneo") (Borneo) and the LimeTree hotel, we packed our bags and took a few last photos of the towers. Our flight was early, and our taxi was leaving at 7am.

Next morning, when we left, the moon was still out. Through KL’s morning rush hour, along the freeway, back past the condominiums, endless high rises and Asian suburbia, we drove through the eerie mist and palm plantations to the airport. At the LCC terminal, with a cheap Starbucks breakfast, [we boarded the AirAsia flight to Sarawak](/2014/05/kuching-borneo/ "Kuching, Borneo"). Goodbye KL, we’ll see you again in a couple of weeks.
