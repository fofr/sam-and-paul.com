This was a last minute holiday. On Monday we decided to go away, on Wednesday we booked it, and on Sunday, at 4am, we were headed to Gatwick, flying with EasyJet to Catania. We'd found a delightful 5-star hotel on the island of Vulcano, part of the Aeolian islands which are north of Sicily, Italy.

Getting to Vulcano is a bit of a trek. From the airport, with baggage in tow, we boarded a Giuntabus to Milazzo. It followed the coast, around the base of Mount Etna for 90 mins, through Messina and miles of tunnels. At Milazzo we boarded an Ustica hydrofoil, normally a smooth 45 minute journey across the water to our destination. But today the sea was rough, and unbeknownst to us, you shouldn't ever sit at the front of a hydrofoil. Before long we were clutching our arm rails; the boat crashed into waves and the nose veered up and down, our stomachs in our mouths, water smothering the windows, a buoy smashing the sides. The children, of which there were many, squealed in equal measures of terror and delight. Poseidon's roller coaster had set sail.

An hour into our 45 minute journey, and our predicament hadn't changed, the up-n-down up-n-down motion continued. Only now the hydrofoil’s passengers were silent. Everyone had turned a shade of green, and with concentration we all struggled to hold down our lunch, praying for the journey to end. The kids gave way first, and a yellow shirted crewman arrived with a sick bag moments too late. The kids were sick, the passengers were sick. One family were carrying a cat in a pet box, even the cat vomited — the poor thing look stunned.

Miraculously Samantha and I held out, and after 90 minutes we were on dry land, but greeted by the bad-egg sulphur smell of Vulcano's nearby mud baths. Our smiling wide-eyed hotel rep enthusiastically greeted us, and from the minibus to the hotel pointed out the sights. It took all of Sam's ability to focus and hear her words. I should say now, the return journey was a non-event, it was even pleasurable. I'll repeat our learnings: never sit at the front of a hydrofoil.

Our hotel, [Therasia Resort Sea & Spa](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g642173-d628059-Reviews-Therasia_Resort-Isola_Vulcano_Aeolian_Islands_Islands_of_Sicily_Sicily.html), introduced itself with breathtaking views. Perched on the northernmost corner of Vulcanello, a small volcano, it looks out at a 180º vista of the Aeolian islands. From left to right we saw Alicudi, Filicudi, Salina (housing six volcanoes), Lipari — directly in front, Panarea, and in the distance to the right, Stromboli, a regularly erupting volcano dubbed “Lighthouse of the Mediterranean”. Between us and Lipari there lay only a thin channel of water, at most 1km across, and frequented by ambient sailboats. Lipari itself rises quickly into the sky, leaving behind two characteristic rocky outcrops to the West, like the ruined pillars of an ancient monument. It is these small rocks which make the view unique, and magical, and from where the hotel derives its insignia. Night and day, for six days, through sunrise and sunset, this view remained wondrous. Looking into it we felt privileged, and became calm and reflective, our pefect sea of tranquility.

In such surroundings the hotel itself has much to live up to, and it does so, magnanimously. An infinity pool melds seamlessly with the sea, and is surrounded by unobtrusive cacti. The site is built into the rock in tiers, each tier with its own unobstructed and unique view, whether it's from the breakfast table at L'Arcipelago, a table at the Michelin recommended Il Cappero, the bar at reception or your room. In the foyer stone arches give the building a sense of grandeur befitting its environment. The staff were both friendly and helpful, and by the end of the week we couldn't help but treat many of them like friends.

Our room was modest, the cheapest room available, with a garden view — the crater of Vulcano smouldering in the distance. But it too was lovely, whitewashed with a stone tiled floor, a hidden and near silent air conditioner and a bed that slept us soundly every night. The minibar was free, and the room even had complimentary flip-flops. Twice a day our room was kept both clean and tidy, our clothes neatly folded, a little almond treat left by our bedside at night.

Come the rest of our first day, all we could do was nap and eat dinner. From L'Arcipelago we watched our first sunset, the red glowing ball silently vaporising itself in the salty ocean.

Therasia's breakfast spread is one to be marvelled. Champagne is included, as are ten types of milk, and juice. And the food, oh the food. Fresh fruit, freshly made Sicilian treats and cakes, over twenty honeys, bread done 15 different ways, salmon, tuna, fine hams and salami, italian cheeses, eggs done anyway you want them and even a crêperie. We gorged ourselves, as much as one can at breakfast.

Our days were restful, we didn't venture out much, choosing instead to lounge by the pool and read our books. I made my way through A Brave New World, stopping only to cool down in the light blue water or to reapply sun lotion. At the poolside bar we often ate stone baked pizza, sometimes with a Moretti beer to wash it down.

When we did eventually venture out on our first day, we obviously did so at the wrong time, about 2pm. Leaving the confines of the hotel, we also left the sea breeze, and the roads were hot and stuffy. But we persisted, and walked down to Baia Negra, a black sand beach, then along to the smelly mud baths, and quickly away into town. It all took about two hours, and by the quiet port we took the shuttle back home.

That night we returned, to eat at [Maurizio's](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g642173-d2314438-Reviews-Ristorante_La_Forgia_Maurizio-Isola_Vulcano_Aeolian_Islands_Islands_of_Sicily_Sic.html), he was fully booked, except for a lonesome table on the street. It was a quiet street, at times quieter than the restaurant, and it afforded us personal service and the chance to watch the world go by. The sky turned pink, then blue, and the first stars appeared. It was warm outside. Maurizio lavished on us his preprepared free hors d'oeuvres (Sam devoured the black bean and spelt with all the potato bread), then Spaghetti Eoliana and Zucchini Linguine, followed with fried Calamari and Swordfish in breadcrumbs. And when we were stuffed, unable to eat anything more, one more treat: almond biscotti and almond wine. “Thank you ever so much”, Sam told Maurizio, “ah, but what for?” he casually replied.

On Tuesday the view at breakfast was even more magical. The colour of the distant sea perfectly matched the blue hue of the sky, and boats and islands alike appeared to hover strangely in the air.

After our fruit salad, cappuccino and salmon on toast, we left the hotel early, eager to explore the island a little more. Our aim was to reach the top of Vulcanello, a small volcano to the north. The hot roads that lacked a sea breeze were lined with those characteristic red Sicilian flowers, planted but gorgeous nonetheless. Going East we searched for a walk up to the volcano crater, but every entrance seemed private. We took a short detour through the dry woodland and along a dirt path, hopeful, but as it turned south, and eventually stopped exactly nowhere, we gave up the expedition.

Finding the main road again, and continuing East, we avoided town and discovered a sailboat marina, (“marina di vulcanello”). The trees and land opened up to a quiet bay with unobstructed views of 'the Vulcano volcano'. From the end of the jetty we sat and watched the hydrofoils come in, and the sailboats gently go out, while the sulphur rose up behind them.

We also found Vulcano Blu, another resort, and at the end another view North, with grand views of Lipari, Panarea and Stromboli. The latter of which only visible at the time by a characteristic white puff of smoke escaping its peak. Being next to a resort we had the good fortune of stumbling on a pool and bar, in a place which would otherwise be the middle of nowhere. Sat by the pool, listening to a CD blast out Madonna's “Ray of light”, and The Lighthouse Family, we recuperated with a panini and salad, washed down with cold iced tea and a guilty coke.

On the walk home we found a lost German tourist. She was elderly, looked very hot and couldn't speak a word of English. We couldn't make out what she wanted, or where she was going; Sam's broken German gave us the odd clue. Without anything around for miles, and in the heat, we led her to our hotel where a German speaker could undoubtedly help. En-route we flagged down a car, and the driver, one of the friendly hotel receptionists we knew came to the rescue — she drove us back and, after conversing in German, explained that the lady wanted to get a boat from the main port but was desperately lost. At the hotel our German friend thanked us and cooled down in the bar before taking the complementary shuttle bus to town. With our Good Samaritan task complete, we relaxed by our pool until dinner.

Once again the day came to an end, and the sun set perfectly into the sea. This time we came ready, and with tripod setup we endeavoured to capture something beautiful. Silhouettes, long exposures, pool reflections, sea reflections, funny dances in front of the camera, we had a lot of fun, though that perfect shot, that one that might capture the essence and beauty of the moment, it eluded us.

At 9pm, when the sun was gone, we found our table at [Il Cappero](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g642173-d4053033-Reviews-Il_Cappero_at_Therasia_Resort-Isola_Vulcano_Aeolian_Islands_Islands_of_Sicily_Sic.html), the Michelin recommended posh restaurant, from which we ordered the seven course tasting menu. Our table looked out at the islands, and as the night drew on the silhouettes of each island disappeared, until, in the dark, we could make out only the shape of Lipari, marked by the hue of a town out of sight. Below us the Octopus fishermen were out in there one-man boats, trawling up and down the channel, leaving their nets with a flashing light.

Our meal was delightful. From the lobster served in cappuccino, an inspired idea, to risotto served from a scolding basalt rock, it was all quite delicious. Right up to the small pistachio dessert, which was actually a large pistachio dessert and not to Sam's fancy; our host was mortified and quickly provided an alternative, 'the essence of cannoli', lovely chocolate cream and biscuit. I joked with Sam about all the possible foods they might bring out as a replacement, desserts Sam also wouldn't like: raisins, sultanas, cinnamon, liquorice — the list goes on, that inconvenience was spared us.

</div>

We retired for the night, but not before a quick perch by the nighttime pool, to watch the stars, the boats and the bats, which flew down in front of us to drink the pool water.

In our infinite wisdom we decided to wake before dawn, to see the sun's beautiful light from the other side of the sea, and to get some good photos. But the horizon was a little hazy, and the sunrise disappointingly unspectacular. Still, it didn't stop Sam wandering the deserted hotel trying to make an image worth keeping. I meanwhile returned to bed and tried to stay awake until she returned, after all, we only had one set of keys, and she didn't have them.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Dawn on Vulcano](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/vulcano-032.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/vulcano-032.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Dawn on Vulcano</figcaption></figure>

Today's itinerary read as follows: breakfast, pool, volcano. Salmon on toast was replaced with tuna steak on toast, and at the pool we donned our fluorescent green flip flops and bagsy'd the best sun chairs. In A Brave New World, Bernard Marx was headed out to see the savages, and above me an unmarked army helicopter and then a low flying cargo plain flew by, weaving between the islands, practically at eye level. It upset the tranquility somewhat, but Sam missed all the palaver, she was downstairs getting a tour of the spa.

For lunch we ate a stone baked pizza, with fruit and vanilla milkshake. Most of the afternoon was spent sitting with our new friends Susie and Brian, honeymooners, one scottish and one south african. Samantha has a unique ability to befriend strangers, and I tag along for the ride. They ran a shipping company, liked Game of Thrones and were big rugby fans.

At 6pm, and thoroughly relaxed, we set off to scale Vulcano, to go up when the light was right, when the heat wouldn't be overbearing and when it might all be a little bit perfect. Sunset was 8:30pm, and we reckoned two hours was enough to get us to the top. From the minibus, through town, up to the gravel entrance, and onto the sandy ash path. It was like climbing a beach, or a sand dune, sliding down slightly with every rising step. Sam, in all her preparedness was carrying far too much and wore too many clothes; red faced and panting she was overheating, and we were only 200m into the climb. She had her walking boots, trousers, t-shirt and a shirt covering her shoulders; I was in sandals, shorts and an unbuttoned short sleeved shirt. We took it slow, I carried the tripod, and Sam took tiny steps, which made it all the more arduous, every step had a cost. 300m, 400m, 500m, 600m, and finally the sand gave way to encrusted mud — a path carved out of the volcano wall, and the trek became easier. Beneath us the town, Vulcanello and the Aeolian islands spread out, with the sun casting beautiful shadows across the hills.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--portrait">[![Beginning the trek up Vulcano, to the Gran Cratere](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/vulcano-036.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/vulcano-036.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Beginning the trek up Vulcano, to the Gran Cratere</figcaption></figure>

The climb was 900m in total. At the top we found ourselves on the precipice of the volcano's crater, Gran Cratere. It wasn't spewing lava or anything, it had collapsed in on itself one hundred years ago, but there were thick sulphur fields to the East, blowing plumes of toxic smoke out into the world. And that's the smell that hits you at the top, yucky bad eggs. Still, the crater was enormous, and the eruption must have been a sight (it's a Vulcanian type of eruption, namesake and all). Sam was in a mild state of delirium, overheating, red faced and being irritable — yet this wasn't the finale, we still needed to circumnavigate the crater to reach the tallest peak on the south side. Sam let out a sort of moan, but we continued.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![View from Vulcano](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/vulcano-049.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/vulcano-049.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">View from Vulcano's Gran Cratere volcano</figcaption></figure>

Around the crater there's a thin path, trekked by a hardy few. Avoiding the sulphur fields, we took the long route round, to our left the sharp decline into the crater, on the right a larger drop, down the side of the volcano. A sombre cross with flowers highlighted the danger. As we trekked onwards the sun drew closer to the horizon. And all the bugs were out, tiny little black things determined to bite and nibble at you unless you keep moving. We eked round to the peak, and guzzled down most of our juice and water. Just as Sam made it to the pinnacle, and as she wearily raised her hands in success, a jogger breezed past her, without a bead of sweat on his brow, casual as you like.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Circumnavigating the crater to reach the peak](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/vulcano-045.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/vulcano-045.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Circumnavigating the crater to reach the peak</figcaption></figure>

What a magnificent view from the top. We could see all eight Aeolian islands, in all their glory, spreading right across the horizon. The light had turned red, and the sun began to dip behind Filicudi; perfect timing. With a bit of a rest and some fluids Sam was back to normal and we setup the tripod and had a bit of fun. The angle wasn't quite right, so we jogged down the zig-zag path, back to the rim of the crater, and towards the sulphur fields; the smoke flowed over the cusp of the crater and down, mesmerising. We paused and watched the sun disappear, just like the night before, and the one before that, perfectly and smoothly collapsing into the sea, gorgeous, you can't ever grow tired of it, beautiful and fleeting, a little bit of planetary magic, and then it was night time. And then we were on a volcano at night.

After all that photo taking, and with the sunset over, we had the mild problem of getting past the molten sulphur field, in the dark, and in sandals. We found a thin path upwind, and avoided the worst of it. But some sulphur vents were a little too close for comfort; they whizzed and hissed as we crept by, angry yellow chimneys with yellow slug trails. Where we couldn't avoid the smoke plumes we held our breath and ran through, the air warm on our legs and sharp on our nose. Hop, dash, jog, and done, nothing too bad.

It took us a mere 20 minutes to get down again, including the occasional night shot. Sweaty, and without doubt pungent, we entered the relaxed [Ristorante Vincenzino](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g642173-d1547848-Reviews-Ristorante_Vincenzino-Isola_Vulcano_Aeolian_Islands_Islands_of_Sicily_Sicily.html) for our evening meal. It was a nice little place, fairly casual, and the food was great; I chose randomly and had tuna steak pasta with fennel, raisins and pine nuts, and plenty of olive oil. Sam took the waitresses suggestion and had lovely pasta and prawns.

We finished up just in time for the 11pm shuttle back to the hotel.

Thursday was delegated a spa day. In our hotel robes we sauntered down to the free spa, my first real spa experience. We weren't going for any fancy treatments or massages, those things cost money. I got a little tour, there was a hot and dry Swedish sauna, a humid Turkish sauna, some funky showers that fired water in peculiar ways, and an indoor pool with massaging water jets and whirlpools; sitting down, standing up, on your back, between your toes, bubbles pummelled you in new and exciting ways. There was also a cold pool, kept at a balmy 10C, something you're meant to walk through after being in the sauna.

At first all this sounded like torture. The steam in the Turkish spa stung my nose, and the hot room was too hot, but after a couple hours and a few cycles through each, I was like a relaxed spa pro — yes, I'd happily do this for money. And tea, there was black tea, smooth scrumptious complimentary tea to end on.

Today was a little cooler and the sky was dotted with clouds. Still, the pool and our books beckoned, and the hours passed by until evening. At 8pm, ready for the sunset with wide angle lens and tripod, we waited with cocktails and bar snacks. The sun streamed through the gaps in the clouds, but never quite lit them in a spectacular way. We took the shuttle into town after that, perused some shops, and were at Maurizios for 9pm, we'd made a reservation this time and had the luxury of sitting inside the restaurant.

It's a quirky peculiar place. The walls are brushed with gold, and oriental and kitschy ornaments hang together, a large mirror with words sprawled across it, two great japanese parasols and a great bejewelled metal chandelier that looked like the imaginings of a 1920s futurist, half rocket half light fitting. Maurizio welcomed us back, and this time around we enjoyed sardine pasta and pasta del mare, being careful not to order too much. The dessert gift was this time a cardamon wine, with almond biscotti; by description neither of us should like it, but we can't say we didn't.

On our last full day we didn't fancy doing much. Sam's kayaking tour was cancelled and an all day boat trip to Stromboli isn't the best way to relax before travelling home (though probably a trip we should have done, it sounded good). We went for a 'casual walk' instead, to a new part of the island. From town we found Baia Negra, and continued south from there, looking for a footpath up into the hills. But the map's marked path was closed, so we followed the unshaded roads up to the Lentia viewpoint on the west of the island. It was baking and the tarmac was hot to the touch.

Lentia itself is a small village of expensive holiday homes, with a pool, a bar and a tennis court; the latter with its tall fences placed right against the best of the views, a tragedy. We stopped for a Cornetto and headed back. Looking south on the return journey, we could see Sicily and the rest of Vulcano. Beneath us were cute coves and miniature beaches, reachable only by boat.

It wouldn't be a Sam and Paul holiday unless we had some fresh bread, cheese and salami as a cheap picnic lunch from the local supermarket. We picked up some snacks and Malvasia for home too, and enjoyed a homemade lunch on our hotel balcony. We spent our remaining hours in the pool until the sun began to dip. We packed our clothes, dressed up for dinner and meandered the hotel with our camera and tripod.

We returned to Il Cappero for our final meal, this time choosing the five course menu, but selecting the same cheap but delicious Sicilian white wine, a bottle of course, “we won't drink all of it”, Sam said, mistakenly.

We sat facing the islands and the sea, a magical place. As the light faded, on the day and on our holiday, the islands disappeared one more time. The fishermen returned, for their nightly plunders, and in the cool night air, against the stars, with wonderful food, and in each others company, we felt lucky and couldn't have been more happy.

The return trek was without hitch, despite my worries. On the smooth Siremar hydrofoil we travelled to Milazzo, with enough time for a quick coffee break in the “CD Bar” cafe. Then onwards in a cramped minibus to Catania airport and all of its EasyJet queues. Queues for baggage, queues for passport control, queues to get on the plane that hasn't finished refuelling, and so on, anything but easy. The airport was disorganised too, and I accidentally strolled through the security gate with a wad of change in my pocket, without so much as a beep. On the plane we had fresh bread and cheese, leftovers from Friday, and once more we enjoyed a decent high altitude meal (not quite as good as our doggy-bagged steak when coming home from Madeira).

England welcomed us home with its first prolonged heat wave since 2006, the Lions won the Australian tour, and Andy Murray won wimbledon.

What a stunning and relaxing holiday. Sublime wonderful views of Aeolian islands combined with the agreeable, cheerful and quite perfect Therasia hotel. It gave us the time-off we ever so needed. Five star recuperation by the sea, it does the trick.
