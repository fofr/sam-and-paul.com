## Coastal walk

Continental breakfast brought few surprises, and we gorged ourselves on croissants, cheese, meats, bread and Nespresso (no proper coffee to be seen).

With back packs stuffed full of sun cream, towels, change of clothes and other heavy stuff Sam might need but probably won’t use, the whole of Cadaqués beckoned. The coastal walk from east to west revealed its treasures - dirt paths and rocky walkways, through cacti, to hidden beaches and rocky outcrops where you can sit and paddle, then around to the old town and the gorgeous views on approach.

The back roads are thin and labyrinthine, similar to [Molyvos](/2008/09/two-weeks-in-molyvos-in-lesbos-greece/), and its apparent why scooters are popular. Purple vines grow up the whitewashed walls towards the deep blue sky above.

For a cheap lunch we had the €12 set menu at Es Taronger, including wine.

* Gazpacho
* Moules
* Salmon and chips
* Ice cream

All that walking was sweat inducing, and an ice cold pool soon put sort to that.

## es Baluard restaurant

In our evening dress, we passed a huge mechanical dragon, being slayed by a conquistador (as you do!) - a converted car with built in fireworks.

In the high ceiling’d and overly lit Restaurant, es Baluard, recommended by the Lonely Planet, we settled with white wine for the evening.

{% menu %}
* Bread and olives
* Spider crab and octopus paella (shared)
* Profiteroles with hot chocolate sauce
* “Bescuit” ice cream with hot chocolate sauce
{% endmenu %}

Digging into the spider crab paella with industrial strength pliers, we spent an hour stabbing and scraping at the tastiest bits, hidden deep inside the legs. Sam only hit the wall with flying crab shards the once, the rest landed on my plate. Whilst the crab was tasty, we didn’t eat it fast enough and the rice was soon cold. The rich hot chocolaty desserts were fantastic.
