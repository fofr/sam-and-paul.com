We flew Gol airlines to Foz do Iguacu, and with our Lonely Planet guide we knew to sit on the left side of the plane for the best view of the falls. It only took an hour or so to get there, and when we landed at 3pm it felt like a different country; clear skies, 30C and a hot wind.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-083.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-083.jpg)

Outside the airport we befriended a Canadian couple going to the same place as us, and we waited half an hour for the green bus that runs every 20 mins. Eventually it arrived and we paid the R$3 bus fare to Parque Nacional do Iguaçu before struggling to lift our heavy backpacks over the in-bus turnstile whilst the vehicle zoomed around a corner, flinging us left and right. Turnstiles are a trait common to all brazilian buses. At the park we paid the R$40 entrance fee and caught an in-park bus towards the waterfalls.

We were staying at Hotel Cataratas, a five star orient express hotel. This was our splurge, a small slice of decadence and a chance to indulge in a little grandeur and opulence. After all, we’d had a friendly cheque from the HMRC, so why not treat ourselves?

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-110.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-110.jpg)

Despite a spa, pool, gourmet food and utter luxury, the main advantage of this hotel, and the reason we stayed here, is its location. It’s the only hotel inside the national park and gives all guests unrestricted access to the park whilst it is closed to the public. So, at sunset, or even sunrise, you can have the place to yourself, without teems of tourists. The hotel entrance is a mere minute walk from your first spectacular view of the waterfalls, but set back enough so as not to distract from the scenery. It’s the hotel all visitors wish they were staying at.

We’d booked a pricey two nights, and arrived at 5pm, just as the park was closing. We checked in, and a porter took our bags to the room, via the wide pink pastel corridors and wildlife oil paintings. A super king size bed, his and her sinks and walk in shower greeted us, along with a pair of trendy Havaianas flip flops each, handy for being poolside or during waterfall visits. Outside the window all you can see is jungle treetop.

The sounds of nature enriched the place, birds nested above the restaurant and huge lizards scuttled about, as if on a day trip from the forest. Swallows flitted down and drank from the pool. By the pool we covered ourselves in bug repellant and sun lotion and tried a vanilla ice cream and coke cocktail.

Time to explore the ‘cataratas’ (falls) for the first time. Starting at the viewpoint closest to the hotel we took the 1.2km trilha das cataratas that follows the river shore. The first view shows a phenomenal crescent of two tiered waterfalls out across the other side of the river (on the Argentinian side).

It was dusk, and wildlife was coming out for the evening. Butterflies were everywhere, and they weren’t shy landing on you. From the 88 butterfly (diaethria clymena) to large spiders weaving their webs and millipedes walking out in front of you, the bugs and insects were abundant and you needed to be careful where you put your hands. Giant black and white tegu lizards scared us as they ran out in front of us, across the trail. Some reached up to four foot in length.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-089.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-089.jpg)

As I was knelt down taking a photo of a spider, a four foot coatis clambered down beside us, sniffing around for food, “Paul, turn around, turn around now”, Sam whispered. A coatis is a sort of racoon and is common to northern Argentina. He clearly didn’t care what we were up to and was happy for us to snap some photos.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-120.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-120.jpg)

The paved route had a green wooden barrier, and headed down towards the waterfall climax, Garganta do Diablo, with the occasional look out point. Every view along the trail was awesome, using the true meaning of the word; we couldn’t believe the power and beauty of the place as the constant sound of crashing water surrounded us, amidst blue orange skies, the odd fluffy white cloud, the fascinating wildlife and luscious forest.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-095.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-095.jpg)

Then we reached Garganta do Diablo, where there is a walkway right out into the middle of the thundering waterfalls. The spray from the falls is like heavy rainfall, and walking out you are going to get soaked. We braved it with our bags and Sam donned a poncho for the occasion, I risked the camera too in it’s waterproof bag. Out into the falls we eked, the cold refreshing water driving into our faces, water drops trickling down our cheeks, soaking and delighting us. From the edge of the final platform you can look right down into the abyss, where the river plunges deeper into the darkness, so far and so deep all you can see is the rebounding spray and the occasional crazy swallow flying into the waterfall.

This must be one of the most beautiful places on the planet and we had it all to ourselves at sunset. We took a moment to appreciate the glory of nature as the sun disappeared on the Argentinian side of the park and as flocks of swallows flew high above us. We slowly meandered back to our hotel, a little sopping, in awe of what we’d just experienced.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-106.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-106.jpg)

That night we tried the hotels buffet. Sat outside by the pool we made our wine selection (or beer, I had Skol) as the nighttime frogs serenaded us and the neon blue fireflies painted the forest with light.

We tried a bit of everything from the buffet. The traditional moqueca fish was lovely, as was the barbecued steak, lamb and pork, potato salad and squid salad. We filled ourselves to the brim, but still had every type of dessert; passion fruit mousse, a yellow egg yolk cream, light strawberry mousse, a cointreau creme caramel and a strawberry layered trifle, and many more we can’t remember.

We stumbled back to our room, a perfect evening.

The next morning the alarm went off at 6am with the intention of seeing the sunrise over the falls. I wasn’t having any of it and stayed in bed, but Sam, bless her, got up and dressed and went out to the hotel tower to watch the sunrise and the waterfalls.

When we got up the second time we wanted to get out and about early, to do the first guided walking trail in the park. But we got up later than we meant to, rushed our tasty breakfast, hastily booked the wrong tour via the hotel concierge and ran to and from the hotel room a few times. Suffice to say, the morning didn’t go smoothly. But it all sorted itself out and we made it to the Trilha Poço Preto, the walk we wanted to do, with another couple from Chicago.

You can get a jeep or cycle the 9km trail, but we decided to walk it, with the hope of seeing more wildlife. We were accompanied by a young brazilian guide that spoke good English. We took note of the dangerous insects, spiders and snakes before leaving (I secretly hoped to spot one, preferably from a safe distance), covered ourselves in bug spray, loaded up on water and headed into the jungle.

We trekked along a dirt path. Certain plants were tagged with ribbons, marked for scientific use, and our guide excellently explained the flora and fauna we came across. From the beetle that saws through branches, to assorted berries on route - sniffing and squeezing to help identify them. He pointed out animal trails through the trees and identified the bird calls we could hear. The thick throaty call of a Toucan excited us, but we couldn’t spot him in the trees.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-112.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-112.jpg)

The butterflies here were bigger and more beautiful than ever, and there were hundreds of them, including the huge owl butterfly with it’s bright blue inside wing. Great ants wandered around beneath our feet, and large spiders lay in wait for their prey.

The day was warming, and we constantly reapplied the bug spray. We stopped at the sound of a strange squawking, and above us a pair of peculiar birds with huge tail wings were hopping about the treetop, as if they were cats. Our guide explained they had the nickname, “soul of the cat”, and in English they’re known as a squirrel cuckoo. We stood for minutes, necks arched, looking up, mesmerised by their strange jumps and calls.

We pressed onwards, and about half way along our guide heard the sounds of monkeys, and in the distance we saw something jump from tree to tree. Then, without knowing it, a family of capuchin monkeys passed over us, swinging from branch to branch with their long arms, one, and then another, and another, and then a mother with baby clinging onto her back.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-115.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-115.jpg)

Onwards we trekked, 5km, then 7km, then 8km, and picking up the pace to get to the boat. Our guide always happy to answer our questions or point out interesting things, from the great dangling roots of trees, to strangling vines, to protected palms, palmito, burrows in the ground made by birds (and the dirt on nearby branches), the non-native orange tree and efforts to protect the forest and the wild papaya.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-113.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-113.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-114.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-114.jpg)

In between nature we talked about life in Chicago versus England or Brazil, the oddities of language, the history of the park and other travels. All the while on the lookout for something new and exciting in the trees.

After three hours we reached the boat and probably the scariest loo I’ve ever used; filled with large spiders and bees. We strapped into huge orange life jackets and clambered onto the speedboat. Up and down the Iguaçu river we sped, the river wide and shallow, sometimes only a metre deep.

There was some commotion at the front of the boat and we all clambered to see what was going on. On the riverbank a six foot alligator was perched, covered in butterflies. We moved the boat for a closer look, and he slithered back into the river and away.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-117.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-117.jpg)

Next up, tandem kayaking, in the same river as the alligator. As a man that can’t really swim I’ve never canoed or kayaked before, so this proved interesting. Leg over the boat, and shuffle down into the yellow kayak, frightening all the scary looking spiders in there. Push off, and we’re away, heading downstream. Now what?

Sam tried to steer from the rear, and keep us going straight, but we just kept spinning around, narrowly missing felled trees. Only the water’s current kept us going in the right direction. I’d say this tested our marriage, any longer and we might have come to blows with the oars. Exhilarating all the same. If left to ourselves we would be at the bottom of the waterfall, but the boat came to ‘rescue’ us, and our little kayak adventure was over.

Rather than walking the 3km back, arms and legs now thoroughly exhausted, we jeeped it.  On the jeep we passed through a huge swarm of yellow butterflies, they flocked around us and then they were in the distance, a perfect picture, ingrained in our memories, but none of us fast enough with the camera.

Back at the hotel we spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool, with a coconut cocktail and mango juice, and some burgers for dinner (avoiding the pricier dinner menus by getting the poolside food).

Not wanting to break tradition, and to make the most of the surroundings, we went back down to see the waterfalls that evening, for a second perfect sunset. This time we took the tripod and tried capturing some long exposure shots.

The grounds were setting up for the “X-games” the next day, so on the way down we took pictures of Coatis with a group of famous skateboarders. To add to our wildlife list we saw two Agouti rodents (like giant rats but without tails) scavenging for food. Despite the skateboarders on their way back up the trail was quiet, and down by Garganta do Diablo we had the incredible falls to ourselves again. This time we came in swimwear and fully embraced the water. Despite doing it for the second time, it was as amazing as ever, and we stayed until darkness capturing photos and drying off in the warm evening.

Walking back through the jungle in the pitch black is pretty scary. We had a wind up blue LED torch which was about as useful as a lighter. I shined it in the forests to the left and right, hoping not to catch the reflection of any cat’s eyes, I’d love to see a Jaguar, Puma or Ocelot, but now would not be the best time.

As we neared the hotel the blue fireflies came out, and we quietly watched them flit about in the night sky. One came quite close to us and we heard the rumbling noise of a giant insect fly past; it slowly dawned on me that these cute bright lights were massive flying beetles. I shined the light on one; a giant blue light at a giant blue beetle. Of course insects are attracted to the light, and the blue lights started heading in our direction. “Uhhh, run?” … “Run!”

Back at the hotel we had some work to do. This was our last night at Hotel Cataratas and we hadn’t yet planned the rest of the holiday, tomorrow night was unknown. We knew we still wanted to see the Argentinian side of the park and that we had to get to Paraty somehow. Two hours and a couple of beers later and we were fighting over plans in the 24 hour business centre. Sunday flights were all too expensive, going to Argentina for a night was complicated, long distance buses arrived at the wrong times and we needed somewhere to stay. Eventually a plan of action materialised; we’d stay at our hotel another night (another night of luxury can’t be bad!), and on Sunday we’d bus it overnight to Sao Paulo and then on to Paraty. Sorted.

We celebrated our efforts in the piano room with a couple of caipirinhas, until the bar closed.

<!--nextpage-->

The next morning we took full advantage of our buffet breakfast, bagging many pastries for snacks later in the day; yeah, we’re classy. But the chocolate croissants were yummy, and the fresh mango so juicy.

Talking to the hotel concierge we booked our outbound bus tickets and a day-long taxi to take us to Argentina, expensive but worth it for the time we’d gain over five connecting buses.

To get to the Argentinian side, which is just the other side of the river, is a ridiculous one hour trip; out of the park, along the highway, through border control, passports stamped (and a point where you can see Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay all at once), down another highway and into the Argentinian national park. We stopped for currency, converting our Reais to Pesos, amongst all the Christmas decorations going up. What’s more, once over the border the clocks change, Argentina is an hour behind Brazil, so we arrived at the same time as we left.

At the park our driver explained the park tours, the trails and the timings and we arranged a Brazilian meeting time, which we converted to Argentinian time. First up, a boat ride for 400 Pesos, there’s no way we could do the two currency conversions from pesos to reais to pounds in our head, so we just paid it and did it anyway.

Starting at 11am we took a guided jeep tour through the forest to the boat. It wasn’t as good as our guided walk, but it pointed out a lot of similar things on an overly loud speaker system, any timid animals would be long gone.

At the boat we were given waterproof sacks for our bags and big orange lifejackets for the trip. We sat at the front, on sizzling hot plastic chairs that’d been left in the sun too long. The boat departed and we sped upstream, through some rapids towards the falls.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-139.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-139.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-150.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-150.jpg)

At the falls we did one pass so we could take photos and video, taking a look at the righthand crescent of falls and then at the left most ones. Next we put everything away for the crucial second part.

The boat slowly crept towards the waterfalls, a light mist, then a rain shower, then we were right beneath them, getting drenched in a pelting flow of water so powerful you couldn’t keep your eyes open. We got absolutely soaked, through and through. From the boat came screams of delight and excitement as we moved through the falls, eventually coming out again for a breather. Next was the big one, a brief rest-bite before being plunged under another violent force of nature, gallons of water pouring onto us from above, arms spread outwards, screaming. Phenomenal.

Back on land we dripped until small puddles formed around our feet, large orange butterflies flew down to drink from them, and we lay on the rocks, drying off in the hot sun.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-149.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-149.jpg)

From here we did the upper circuit walk, ‘Circuito Superior’. Along the top of the ‘waterfall crescent’, as I call it, there is a constructed walkway which we followed. In flip flops, I looked over the edge and watched the peaceful water turn into a raging torrent. We vied for space and the occasional good view and photo position with groups of kids and elderly coach tours. The people came in waves, and we need only wait a short while for everything to quiet down; it seems most people on this side get a guided tour of the park, which is entirely unnecessary.

The fantastic birds were ever present, including peregrine falcons, plush crested jays that escaped my camera lens, great egret, black vulture, southern lapwing, cattle tyrant (or bandana bird as we called him) and three striped flycatchers.

We stopped for some snacks and a coffee before catching the mini green train up to Garganta do Diablo. Up here is a long walkway across the wide shallow river and there’s not much to see until you’re right out into the so-called devil’s throat, where the plunge is the deepest and the air thick with rebounding mist. Again, you get soaked here too, even though you’re above everything this time. Between the crowds and water splashes we took our pictures quickly. We posed, and smiled and let the water cool us and then it was home time, ushered by staff back to the train because it was 6pm and the park was closing.

On the way back we spotted a turtle resting beneath the metal bridge, and Sam was filled with excitement as on the train we passed a large toucan, she smiled the widest smile, so pleased to have seen a toucan in the wild, and it was awesome, everyone on the train was equally excited.

At the exit we bought some trinkets and met our driver for the return leg, back through border control, changing our clocks and into the Brazilian national park again. Travelling quietly and slowly at dusk, windows down, it was perfect for even more nature watching; we spotted a southern caracara bird on the ground, a few unknown large birds on the telephone wires and an armadillo rummaging in the grass.

We ate in the piano bar again and returned to our plush hotel room.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-171.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-171.jpg)

Our time in Iguaçu falls was coming to a close, and we celebrated our time here with champagne and coffee at breakfast. We packed our bags, sorted our final travel arrangements and checked out. We went for one last walk around the park, this time seeing it with the crowds before boarding our bus and beginning our long journey to Paraty.
