After an overnight stay at the Heathrow IBIS, a bus to the terminal, check-in and an EAT steak sandwich, we were on our Thai Airways flight to Bangkok.

The location of our honeymoon was kept a tight lipped secret until the last moments; Sam believed we were headed for Japan.

The 10 hour flight passed smoothly, and I wrote up our wedding day, much like this. Connect 4, some films and food passed the time.

At Bangkok we waited four hours for our connecting flight to Phuket. 12:30am our time, we were exhausted. Whilst queueing for immigration, the slowest moving queue ever, we spoke with a Korean man about life and travelling.

The 1h30 Phuket flight felt instant, asleep on take off, awake on landing (with a bump). Enter the searing 38C tropical heat. Almost there, just one taxi ride and we were at our destination, the Indigo Pearl, Nai Yang.

Greeted with an iced tea, complete with star of anise and cooling face flannel, we checked in. The Pearl’s decoration and theme was a seamless fusion of metal sculpture, tin mining, wood, tools and luxury, all with an obsessive attention to detail.

After a shower at the fitness centre (and a bug the size of my hand), our room was ready. WOW, the room was incredible. Lotus flowers sat on the super king sized bed, and the hotel’s theme continued; toilet roll holders were shaped like giant bolts, huge wooden sliding doors separated the bed and bathrooms, a large window into the bathroom from the bedroom was intriguing and there was a delicious yet subtle oriental smell of Jasmine and Champaka.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-37.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-37.jpg)

Sleeping from 3pm until 5pm, we awoke starving. Too sleepy to venture out, we ordered room service. A serving of chicken satay, prawns in coconut, deep fried soft shelled crab and some quesadillas shortly arrived, it all looked and tasted gorgeous. The ever smiling and helpful Indigo Pearl staff had a surprise for us; complimentary exotic fruit platter, heart shaped chocolate desserts and a bottle of Champagne. Our jaws almost hit the floor.

Perfectly sated and in paradise, we fell asleep to the thundering down pour of a tropical storm, and an air conditioner turned up full.

13 hours later, 8am, and we were over any jet lag and ready for breakfast. Cereal, croissants, full English were all at the buffet, as expected. But there was also exotic jams (mango, pineapple, banana), beautiful fresh guava, papaya, water melon; lemongrass, mango and orange juices that tasted other worldly; eggs cooked however you wanted, cakes, freshly made waffles, pancakes, spicy Thai noodles, cheeses wrapped in banana leaves to keep them fresh, flavoured breads, salads and sautéed potatoes. And tea and coffee, of course.

Having tried a bit of everything, we headed to the beach to check out our surroundings. Walking down the smooth sandy Nai Yang shore, we dipped our toes in the sea and found a wooden shanty dwelling with a couple of eateries and parasols to rent.

Back at the hotel we spent the day by the pool, with its infinity ledge, jacuzzi, sun bathing spots (in the water) and built-in bar. The fresh juices, cocktails and shakes here are divine.

The sun has set and the light is fading fast; the bugs are awake and the chirps, buzzing and whistles surround me. A storm is moving across the sea in the distance and I can hear Sam talking to a German family in the pool. Lizards are scuttling about, there’s a cool breeze and the bar’s music isn’t too cheesy. Just enough time for a quick dip in the pool.

***

Come evening, post burger/mango and aubergine salad, we realised our sun lotioning had lacked vigilance, we were both, me more-so, a little lobster like. With careful preparation, avoiding glowing red feet and arms, we dressed smart and headed to Black Ginger, an air conditioned restaurant on stilts in the middle of a lake.

Shoes off before entering (a Thai custom), we were seated with a view of the distant storm. Opting for the three course set menu we shared prawn crackers, green curry beef with lemongrass, soups with ginger and banana in coconut milk.

Day 3, Thursday, and it was the end of our brief but wonderful spell at Indigo Pearl. Breakfast, beach walk and a dip in the pool and we were off, using their concierge to book a rental car and drive to Adamas, just down the coast.

The rental was a Toyota Yaris, and I had to get used to driving an automatic. Phuket’s roads are well laid, and easy to drive. The difficult bit comes in dealing with the peculiar actions of other drivers and copious mopeds and bikes - often with 2 or 3 (or even a dog) riding along. Bikes with side cars would swerve out, without indication, and trucks carrying 20 people on the back would undertake if you weren’t breaking the speed limits. Down the unnecessarily winding road with hidden speed bumps, we arrived at Adamas, with a small sigh of relief.

Adamas looks out across the Nai Yang bay, a beautiful sea vista greets you when you check-in, and it’s all very serene. Our room was on the second floor and it offered another stunning view. The bed could have slept four, it was so big, and the bathroom had the same intriguing partition as Pearl’s. Rose petals and two love birds made from towels were on the bed. The swimming pool swept around the resort, with a central garden and an infinity ledge looking out at the sea. Small turtles formed steps into it, from pool side rooms.

We chilled out in the lounge with a cocktail served in a pineapple, being sure to cover ourselves with anti-bug spray beforehand. After a spot of snooker, we had food at the bar, a tasty pad thai served in an egg net with prawns and ground nuts and Salmon with garlic and black pepper.

Friday was a day of driving and Phuket exploration. Setting off early we hit the main roads at rush hour, complete with swarms of motorcyclists. A quick stop at the boat lagoon to check out the available tour options and to book Saturday’s day trip, then driving further south to Wat Chalong, our first temple experience.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-67.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-67.jpg)

Hats and shoes off before going in, the ornate buildings with golden Buddha images were a cool sanctuary from the heat. Locals sat in a mermaid position, bowing towards the figures, burning incense and occasionally letting off firecrackers. Coconuts were on sale for 25B and stalls sold cheap clothes and ornaments. We avoided the hole in the ground toilets and returned to the air conditioned car, smartly parked under a tree in the shade.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-70.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-70.jpg)

Back onto Phuket’s roads, a couple of U-turns and up a winding hill, we travelled to the Big Buddha. A 20 year old building project that puts an enormous statute atop of Phuket’s largest hill.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-71.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-71.jpg)

At the top, in the midday sun, without any shadow, we took our photos, made a donation and read about the history. Huge sculptures sat around the base of the Buddha, waiting to be hoisted into place, the eyes went in in December.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-72.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-72.jpg)

Part way down the hill we stopped at a small shack for lunch. It had a fantastic view of Karon beach. Coke, chicken with cashew nuts and a red curry with peanuts and chicken were our choices. Sam took some moments to snap flowers on the hillside, and a gecko that came down from the tree, before we made our way south.

Following the Lonely Planet guide, we found the recommended Kok Chang elephant safari. For 1000B each we enjoyed a one hour trek into the forest, to the top of the hill on the back of a charming elephant. The elephant’s hairs were itchy against my legs and on the way back down keeping balance and staying on was a bit of a challenge, although it felt much more sturdy and safe than riding a horse. The elephant’s mahout stopped half way and took some great shots of us.

We continued south to Leam Promthep cape, the southernmost point of the island, for the much praised sunset. Passing shops with BBQ’d squid and numerous fruits, and after helping green shirted Thai children with their English assignment (“What country you from? What’s your favourite Thai food? What’s different between your country and Thailand? -- I had my answers at the ready, by the sixth time of asking), we sat on the sea front wall to catch a glimpse of the sun disappearing behind a cloud. No beautiful sunset today.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-76.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-76.jpg)

It was now getting dark and everyone scattered as today’s tropical storm was about to hit. Time for a two hour drive up north, at rush hour, in torrential rain amidst Thailand’s drivers, all in the dark. Huge lightning forks lit up the sky every few seconds, and the rain blurred the distinction between lanes.

We were aiming for a restaurant at Bang Tao, but got thoroughly lost, to the point of frustration and hunger. We stopped at the lovely looking Baan Suan Layan instead, the humidity was overbearing.

With a refreshing watermelon shake, (really very yummy!), we ate cuttlefish with calamari, and sea bream in a yellow curry. Our vietnamese spring rolls were scrumptious.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-79.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-79.jpg)

Home via the winding over-hill route, past Nai Thon beach, we slept well, thoroughly exhausted.

<!--nextpage-->

Saturday, we were awake at 6am, ready for our Phuket Adventure pickup at 7:45am. On the speedboat by 9, we joined some German families, a dutch family, an Australian couple and some Spaniards, as we jetted across the calm waters towards the small Coral island, for sandy beaches and a spot of snorkelling (after a bit of time getting the seal working). Carefully avoiding the coral and potential cuts, we spotted beautifully coloured fish, hundreds of them, it wasn’t hard -- they swam right past our noses.

After dusting off the wet sand, back on the boat we made the one hour journey north to Phang Nga and its astounding limestone formations and caves. Darting around the towering islands there were eagles and iguanas, canoeists and copious stalactites. The whole time we sat back, necks arced, head looking up in wonder.

For lunch we stopped at the floating muslim town (Koh Panyi island), which survives on tourism. “Like Venice”, they said, but not really. The heat was frazzling and we kept to the shade as we wandered the streets. Women carried monkeys  in babies clothing, dried seafood was for sale by the bucket-load and children pushed postcards at us. Buy, buy, buy. We ate fish, curry, salad, chicken and soup before hopping off again to “James Bond island” (from “The Man with the Golden Gun”), otherwise known as Kho Tapu.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-88.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-88.jpg)

The picturesque and now famous formations were accompanied by the usual tourist kitsch; key chains et al. And as an Englishman, that bears no resemblance to James Bond, many Thais wanted their picture taken with me, which was odd. Crossing sandy shores and wading through the sea a bit, we found a trail that took us round to another part of the island, quiet, secluded and beautiful.  

The final stop on the boat was another beach island, for swimming etc, although thick clouds moved in and the day’s storm wasn’t far off. We sped through heavy rain and no one felt like bathing by the sea. Instead we took a quick walk around the island, kicking about some old coconut shells, before being whisked back to the Phuket mainland.

Back at the hotel by 6, enough time to get changed and be out on the road in the sun light - when the roads are clear enough to navigate correctly to Bang Tao and the Lotus Restaurant.

The entrance takes you past tanks of fish, lobsters, crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, blue crabs, through to the restaurant. We took a quick stroll along the gorgeous beach in the cool night air before being seated, close to the water feature and a good distance from the live entertainment.

Mango and watermelon shakes were followed with chicken in pandanus leaves and shrimp cakes. For mains we HAD to have something fresh; I pointed at the Red snapper tank and fished out my main course, Sam chose to have a blue crab, grabbed by our waiter (it almost got away when it was weighed). The fish came in a tamarind sauce and the crab with a salad, on the side we shared pad thai and prawns. Yum yum yum.

We closed the night with another stroll along the beach, dipping our toes in the sea, and watching the spectacular fireworks, “please step back, I make big firework”.

Easter Sunday was a day of rest and the big Indigo Pearl rose brunch. Free flowing sparkling rose was just the tip of the iceberg.

There was fine cheese and cured ham; thirty types of sushi, takoyaki (Japanese dumplings with octopus), sashimi picked from the fish--including a great big Tuna; lobster, mantis shrimp, oysters and crab; miniature dishes of beef and asparagus, squid, roasted butternut squash, feta cheese, mixed seafood and others; a barbecue where you choose what you’d like cooked, including three types of steak, lamb chop, sausage, corn on the cob, salmon, squid, king prawns and fish of the day; indian curry selection; vegetable and roast selection; a hog roast with mustard and dressings; roasted lamb ribs; hoisin duck and anything you wanted stir fried or curried; complimentary starters from the chef; desserts of all varieties, 15 flavours of ice cream, cheesecake, chocolate cake, easter egg; waffles and pancakes freshly made; fresh fruit including mango and dragon fruit, thick smoothies, chocolate pots; and tea and coffee.

It was all presented on magnificent ice sculptures of swans and elephants, with extremely attentive, friendly and helpful staff - always with a smile on their face, even carrying your food laden plate back to the table for you.

Whilst our bellies got over their fullness (Sam must have eaten enough for a week!), we relaxed to the live music with a view of the pool, covers of Lady Gaga to Dire Straits wafted by as we sat in slumber, occasionally applauding the band for their excellent renditions.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-11.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-11.jpg)

A slow walk back to the beach, sand in our toes, water occasionally hitting them. We chilled out by the pool, ordered a light evening meal at the bar (Sam’s seafood salad was hilariously huge), and chillaxed.

The night time pool dip lead to some mosquito bites, inevitable really.

On Monday, our last day with the car, and in Phuket, we set off early hoping to reach Khao Sok national park. After an hour of driving and a look at the map, the supposed two hour journey looked like it would be more like 3h30 each way. Too much driving for one day. We turned back and instead headed for the gorgeous Phang Nga region, driving down highways through huge towering limestone formations, and through a couple more towns each with their fair share of crazy motorcyclists.

Our destination was the quiet, Sa Nang Manora forest. We left the Yaris in the shade, grabbed a map (of sorts) and stared out on the trail. The canopy provided cover from the sun, but the forest was so humid we were drenched in sweat within minutes.

Past waterfalls, we hiked through the forest; lizards scuttling up trees; cobwebs got caught in our faces and bugs surrounded us; we crossed precarious wooden bridges (aka fallen trees), and climbed small rock faces as the trail took us deep into the forest. No one else around for miles.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-117.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-117.jpg)

We passed numerous water caves, and coves in the limestone housing  bats; butterflies amazed us with their size and colour, and random wild flowers poked out from nowhere.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-119.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-119.jpg)

We trekked for about three hours, stopping in a large cave for snacks; croissants saved from breakfast, now nicely warm in the heat. Without enough food, we turned back and did the walk in double time, speeding onwards at the request of our bellies.

Back at the car park, there were now locals swimming amongst waterfalls, and street vendors had arrived selling food. Coke brought out sugar levels up before we tried yellow watermelon, longan with chilli and sugar mix and then some fried chicken balls and spicy fish cakes, and a spicy chilli dipping sauce alongside.

All from some entertaining thai locals that didn’t believe I was 25 and married. Crispy thin pancakes with luminous fruit sauces ended our purchases.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-123.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-123.jpg)

Back on the road, through the gate on wheels, pulled back by a charming boy, clearly very proud of his role, we headed back, stopping anywhere that took our fancy. Oh to be in an air conditioned vehicle!

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-124.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-124.jpg)

It was good to get well away from the tourist world, and meet some locals not trying to sell us a boat ride. We followed signs for another waterfall, it turned out to be man-made and much less impressive, although it did afford us some lovely views. Next stop, or more like U-turn and dash, was Phang Nga bay, where touts were so eager to sell us their James Bond island trips they’d jump in front of the car. We didn’t stop.

At the Phang Nga national park HQ, we stopped for rice (grumpiest Thai waitresses in the whole of Phuket), and attempted the mangrove trail, but we had to stop at the first bridge, where it had fallen into the sea and cut off the route.

We headed back to the hotel, over the bridge to Phuket, through a checkpoint, past the airport and down the long winding, narrow, dog-ridden, speed-bump ridden road to Adamas, just in time for one more dip in the pool.

To celebrate our last night in the luscious and tropical Phuket, we drove to the Banyan Tree resort, to try french-vietnamese offerings at the upmarket Tre, complete with car valet service.

We ate seven courses and spent a small fortune. Pistachio and asparagus soup; breads and dipping oils; three types of scallop; three types of veal; three types of salmon (including smoked with jackfruit and another wrapped in leaves on a bed of squid ink risotto); raspberry sorbets to cleanse our pallets and three types of pineapple (including with rice wrapped in a pancake, delicious!) and topped off with chocolate ganaches.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/honeymoon-125.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/honeymoon-125.jpg)

We sat with a view across the lake and briefly watched how the other half lived.

Before going home, we pulled up at the beachfront, to watch and photograph the awesome storm. Long shutter times and crossed fingers didn’t result in much.

Our time in Phuket was over, but our honeymoon was moving onto [part 2, Chiang Mai](http://www.sam-and-paul.com/2010/06/honeymoon-part-2-chiang-mai-thailand/).
