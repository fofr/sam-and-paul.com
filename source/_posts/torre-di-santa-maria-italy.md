For our first ever Christmas holiday, until now every Christmas has been spent in the UK at a family home, we’d be spending the holiday season high up in the Italian Alps, in [Torre Di Santa Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_di_Santa_Maria). It’s a small town north of Sondrio, nestled in a valley half way up the mountain. It sits just south of Chiesa and the ski park at Valmalenco.

We travelled with Nana, driving from Brighton to Gatwick, and flying to Milan Malpensa. Meanwhile Amanda and Mitch, Conway’s aunt and uncle, took a more scenic route – driving from Munich through Austria and Switzerland, and through the snow. They brought with them the Christmas essentials – a turkey, minced pies and Christmas pudding, homemade rum truffles, supplies and plenty of presents. Their silver mini-SUV was packed full.

From Milan Malpensa, a mild 15C, we picked up our hire car, a pristine white Audi A4, automatic. This luxury car was cheaper than the standard, so why not? We switched from one to another and paid a bit more for winter tyres, no snow chains thank you. I’d fretted too long about winter driving, snowy roads, blizzards and mountain slopes. Three suitcases, a buggy and all the hand luggage fit neatly into the back and we were off. Making sure to drive on the right side of the road.

It’s a 2 hour drive from Milan to the mountains, and most of it is flat. In the late afternoon sunshine we passed the outskirts of Milan, took a detour through Seregno, zipped by Lecco, and hugged the SS36 alongside Lake Como. I was looking forward to a beautiful and scenic drive alongside the lake, but the SS36 is all tunnel and every glimpse of tranquility is fleeting. We didn’t make this mistake on the way home.

The road turns East and becomes the SS38, following a river between two mountain ranges, its the gateway to the Alps and the only route into Sondrio. Either side of us great mountains rise up, those to the north are snow capped. Smoke from wood burning fires hangs in the valley like a mist over each settlement.

At Sondrio we stopped at Lidl for milk and pizza, then push upwards for the final stretch – a winding but well maintained road into the mountains. Hairpins and steep gradients made easy by our automatic.

It was still mild, 5C, and there was no snow – significantly warmer than we expected, warmer than last week, and not cold enough for the thermals we’d packed or gifted as Xmas presents.

Mitch and Amanda arrived just before us, parked in the garage and had began unpacking. Our Airbnb host, an effusive Italian, Luca, greeted them and then us.

The house had space for two cars – a garage and a drive. The driveway required some magical right-angle turn from a steep and narrow road to squeeze between two tight concrete walls. Our estate didn’t look like such a good idea now. I naively attempted this feat, I asked the car to breathe in to make itself thinner, and Luca and Mitch guided me, with clearance of just a few centimetres, a bit of skidding in mud, and all the car’s proximity sensors beeping we got the car in. But I’d need to do the same again in reverse to get it out. And of course I should have just parked it in the free car park over the road.

“That’s a rich man’s city car, not a car for the mountains”, Luca said, “You have insurance?”. The car was powerful enough to do what we needed with ease, and plenty of people were driving them, but he spooked me and made me worry about driving higher into the mountains, where roads were more treacherous, with my pregnant wife and toddler – which we still did, and which was absolutely fine.

## B&B Bernina

Our Airbnb ([which has its own website](https://berninabb.com/)) had 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms spread over 3 floors. A modern concrete building, rooms and corridors wrapped a central stairwell, it was a long way to the top.

Our Italian home felt like a burrow to hibernate in and shelter from the cold mountains, the outside was hidden. There was underfloor heating throughout, and a wood burning fireplace on the ground floor – keeping us cosy and (a little too) warm. Each window had heavy duty electronic shutters, to shut out the winter and the neighbours.

There were some views, but only if you smushed your face against a window and twisted your neck upwards, where you might glimpse the snowy dust billowing from the mountaintop as the orange evening light disappears from the tip.

We took the top floor – a big double bed with en-suite and an adjoining room for Conway to sleep in, high above everyone else so that night time crying wouldn’t disturb anyone.

The chic polished concrete was decorated with a mixture of art, antique and IKEA. A sparse Christmas tree sat in the corner, abstract oil paintings adorned the walls, a turquoise nude mannequin (“no socks”, Conway exclaimed) stands in the downstairs loo and there’s an ornate metal meat mincer. Rooms are peppered with antique winter paraphernalia and old wooden skis rest beside the dining table.

We settled in, unpacked and ate ravioli, before bed.

On our first full day in Torre Di Santa Maria we sought only to get supplies. Christmas week opening hours were deemed unreliable, though as it turns out, most things were open most of the time.

After cereal, toast and freshly made cake from our attentive hosts, everyone but me and Conway headed out to Sondrio to get everything we’d need for the week – a big shop at Iperal. (Though not before I painstakingly backed the car out of the drive and into a more convenient car park).

Dan and son stayed at home to explore the town, go to the park and take in our surroundings, and when we’d had enough of the warm outside sunshine we went back in and watched Frozen.

## Torre Di Santa Maria

Torre Di Santa Maria is a sleepy little commune built upon the side of a valley – high enough above a river to avoid spring water floods, and low enough that the land isn’t too steep to build on. Snow tops the peaks on either side. The main road passes it by at the riverside. About 800 people live here.

The valley looks directly south and the sun shines straight through, illuminating both sides for a few hours while its low winter path props it above the hills. With the sun hiding, the cold comes quickly.

From the children’s park, with its slide, roundabout, swings and rocking rocket, Conway and I explored. The sky was full of seeds and leaves, spinning round and round, they rained from the forests as if in slow motion. Smoke drifted amongst them and there was a subtle odour of burning wood. There’s a distant sound of a stream, and every hour church bells punctuate the quiet.

Houses are built from stone and they hug the roads tightly, like the passage of cars over a century has eroded the roads into place. Old Italian Fiats sit on cobbles in all the nooks. Small shops here and there sell peculiar assortments – like a cheese shop with a selection of children’s toys.

## Settling-in

Post-shop, the family brought back with them cheeses, and olives and cured meats, alcohols, biscuits and crisps. Pregnant Samantha had made sure she had a fine selection of hard cheeses and alternatives, like sharp apple juice for mulling.

Our host’s father introduced himself, he’d pop-in occasionally to tend the fire, he had only a little English, so we (or those of us who could) spoke with him in German.

For dinner we had pizza, the fire raging safely behind the glass, and when Conway was sleeping we played UNO.

## Taking a snowmobile to a remote restaurant

For Christmas Eve, which is also Mitch’s birthday, we asked our host Luca to book a table at a special restaurant, [La Tana Del Grillo](https://www.tanadelgrillo.it/). He’d told us about a place high up in the mountains, one you can’t drive to. It’s in Chiareggio, a town that’s cut off from the world by snow in winter. To get there we’d need to drive as far as we could, park, then wait for a snowmobile to pick us up and bring us the rest of the way. A perfect Christmas Eve activity.

We began the morning with a big breakfast, coffee, fresh cake and by giving Mitch his birthday presents – including an iron skillet. We were up and out by 11am, taking two cars up the mountain, beneath clear blue skies.

We drove out across the river, away from our sleepy town, going north and up, to Chiesa, then beyond to Valrosera, Vallascia and San Giuseppe. The occasional tight hairpin and steep gradient, the mountain road wound around and around, and up and up. Snow began to appear on the roadside, then on the trees, and then there were piles and piles. Our route brought us through “Serpentinoscisto”, a sequence of 18 hairpins and steep slopes, and up into a winter wonderland.

Luca’s instructions were to keep driving until we reached a stop sign, and it’d be obvious we can go no further. And he was right. The road ended with a car park, and beyond the sign the road was feet deep in snow.

When bringing Conway to the mountains for Christmas we’d envisaged playing in the snow – snowmen, toboggans, snow balls, snow angels, smiles and laughter. Conway had other ideas – he’d never seen snow before and he didn’t want any part of it. He refused to put his coat on, “I’m not cold” he said, and he wouldn’t let his feet touch the snow, let alone play. We wrestled him into his thick coat and hat. Daddy had to carry him.

It wasn’t long before our snowmobile arrived to pick us up. Like a blue jet ski for snow, towing two trailers with seats, we all clambered on. Conway sat between mummy and daddy, a look of uncertainty on his face. Mitch sat up front, on the back of the snowmobile itself.

A jolt, and we’re off. Somewhere between sliding and bumping, we bounced through the snowy wilderness, through pine forests and around the bottom of mountains, “bumpy”, Conway said. Chalets were boarded up and empty for winter, great mounds of snow clung to their rooftops. Small towns sat dormant. After half an hour we reached a place where the lights were on, and smoke billowed from chimneys.

La Tana Del Grillo is a traditional Italian restaurant, in a traditional alpine chalet. Pine wood lines the walls, a stag head watches over. We sat along a long table, and Conway was all smiles and laughter now we’re inside, in the warm, away from that funny white stuff. Through the windows we can see the snowy mountains, and then it begins to snow, and our idyllic Christmas Eve is complete.

We ordered pasta and meat dishes each, I went for the Roe deer steak, “who ordered bambi?” the waitress asked.

* Polenta with venison stew
* Roe deer steaks
* Wild partridge risotto
* [Manfrigole pancakes](https://www.tasteatlas.com/manfrigole)
{% endmenu %}

During lunch Conway began to look sleepy, and he soon nodded off in my arms while I tried to eat my steak around him. We transferred him to mummy to nap some more, and the rest of us ran out into the snow to enjoy it. I wandered up and down the path, looking for views down into the snowy valley where a river runs, while Mitch, Amanda and Nana fought with snowballs and fell about in the deep but soft snow. One wrong foot and you found yourself up to your knees in the snow.

We headed back down the hill on a different snowmobile, the return route faster and bumpier. When Conway woke he was sleepy and grumpy, and was in no mood for photos in the snow. At the bottom we took family pictures in the dying light of the afternoon, then headed back down the mountain, around the hairpins once more, just before dark.

Most of the evening was spent prepping for Christmas dinner – Samantha and Amanda made their list of dishes, with times that everything must come in or come out of the oven. Nana introduced Mitch to her Christmas ritual of watching Santa Claus: The Movie, the one with Dudley Moore.

## Christmas Day in the Alps

It’s Christmas Day! The turkey is on, and there are presents under the Christmas tree. And we’re all together in the alps. We carry Conway downstairs, “Look”, we say, “Presents!”. We ask him if Santa brought them, “No” he says, as though we’re fools, “mummy and daddy brought them”, he’s 2.

Conway picks up each present and gives them out. He carefully undoes the bows and strings on his gifts, until he gets present fatigue and asks daddy to open them for him. There are new socks, new toys, headphones, an American football, handbags, and even tickets to see Queen. The floor is strewn with paper and string and bits of new toys.

Outside there’s glorious sunshine, I take Conway out to the park while everyone else prepares Christmas dinner. We soak up the sun and the quietness as the vegetables are getting peeled. From the park we look around town, up at the church all is quiet – the morning service is over, we heard the bells ring. Conway is sleepy, but not asleep, and as the turkey, potatoes and carrots roast, and as the sweet potato casserole cooks above the fire, we watch the original Toy Story and the smell of red wine and roast dinner fills the room.

Dinner’s ready! And on the table there’s turkey with all the trimmings, bread sauce, roast potatoes, red cabbage and cinnamon, sprouts, stuffing, pigs in blankets, Italian sausage balls, gravy, sweet potato casserole, roasted carrots and onions. “Cheers”, “Merry Christmas”, and we clink our glasses and plastic cups together. Quite an achievement delivering this feast in an unknown kitchen, with a turkey brought from Germany. And it was delicious. We followed it up with mince pies, an alcohol doused Christmas pudding set alight, and lots and lots of cream. And the rest of the day was spent digesting and drinking.

Mummy and daddy go upstairs to open their presents to each other, and Conway helps. And once Conway was asleep we whiled away the hours playing Rummikub and listening to music.

## Boxing Day at Valmalenco

After our day of turkey, presents and chocolate, we needed to get up and out and back up the mountain. Luca recommended Caspoggio, a small town on a mountain to the East, a short drive – it would have child friendly toboggan slopes and an ice rink. We drove out in convoy, across the river then up into the town.

Caspoggio sits on the north face of the mountain, and against the clear blue skies of the morning everything was in a cold and dark shade. We parked, and found the hill with friendly slopes – it was closed while a machine was pumping out snow onto it.

Like on Christmas Eve, Conway was unsettled and didn’t want to be out in the snow. He refused to put on his coat, “I’m not cold”, he said, standing there in his jumper while everyone else has jumpers, coats, hats, gloves. And I carried him. After half an hour we gave up and changed plans. We dropped Samantha and Conway off at the Airbnb and the rest of us headed back out to Valmalenco Ski Resort.

We parked at the Funivia Snow Eagle cable car, and took the vertigo inducing journey up the steep steep incline. High above the town and valley we rose. The sudden changes in air pressure wouldn’t be good for Samantha, who’s 6 months pregnant. The four of us, in our coats and walking boots, were surrounded by all the day’s skiers, high-vis jackets, brightly coloured ski coats, ski boots and skis – we felt a little out of place. At the top I put my head out over the top of the cable car station, and looked straight down.

The cable car arrives at Valmalenco ski resort, which is part of Palu Park. We shuffled across the snow in our boots as people flung themselves down the slopes with great speed. From the cable car there’s another car that takes you down to the main resort, where the ski-hire shops, toilets and cafes live.

Amanda hired a toboggan, and Mitch pushed her down a friendly slope, while Heather and I ate croissants, chips and drank espresso outside in the warm winter sunshine.

Palu Park is meant to have a beautiful alpine lake, and from the slopes there’s a short walk to get to it, if only we could find it. The maps all suggested you needed to ski there. We tried what looked like a little path in the right direction,  we crossed the slopes and dodged all the flying skis to get to it. Through the forest we smushed through the snow and stopped for snow angels. The route brought us to some chalets and a bar, and some more slopes, but no lake. Ah well, it was probably all frozen and covered in snow anyway.

The cable car back down was all the more cramped, and I was happy we hadn’t squished a toddler and a pregnant woman in here with us. A girl was on her way down on a stretcher too.

Back at home we fried up all the Christmas vegetables and left over turkey to make bubble and squeak, which we introduced to Mitch. “Bubble and squeak?”, yeah, that’s the noise it makes while you cook it.

For our last full day in Italy, we didn’t fancy doing much, a day of rest and recuperation, and time to eat all the food we had left over. Sam and I took a quiet stroll around town by ourselves, stopping to look in the church – cold and dark but ornate, there were piles of little paper baubles of all the saints to take home and hang on your tree. We bought pizzoccheri pasta, and had an espresso by the river, sitting outside in the sun until the clouds swallowed it up.

Later everyone else headed into Sondrio for one final shopping trip, while Conway watched The Gruffalo and we packed.

In the evening we tried to teach everyone Carcassonne, and Conway sat on his high chair with his own set of tiles and meeples, which he dutifully arranged and played with. The game ran on a bit and Conway got overtired, and we learnt a valuable lesson – do not give a very tired child any ice cream, especially chocolate. Now we had an overtired child with too much energy.

## A drive home via Lake Como

We packed up all the cars, cleared the Airbnb and said our goodbyes. Amanda and Mitch were driving north into Switzerland for a couple of days, while we would drive out of the mountains, back to Milan for our flight home.

The traffic coming into the mountains was horrendous, queue after queue on the single road in – the first weekend after Christmas, all the Italians were coming for their winter break. Thankfully we were headed the other way, away from Sondrio, through the tunnels and towards Lake Como, where we’d take a scenic drive.

I’d wanted to see Lake Como for years, it was on my shortlist of honeymoon destinations 10 years ago. We took an exit from the highway, which was all tunnel, and drove down the hillside to the water’s edge, parking at the station in Bellano.

By the edge of a misty Lake Como, where the sunlight scattered amongst the southern peaks, and the snow sat clear and crisp on the northern ones, we sat on a quiet bench and ate our turkey sandwiches. Conway enjoyed the ducks which paid us a visit. Then we meandered about the town, following the water, until it was time to get going.

We carried on along the lakeside, driving all the way to Lecco, via Gittana, Perledo, Varenna and Lierna. It was beautiful. Samantha and Heather arched their necks up, to see the steep hills either side, their peaks sometimes wrapped in fluffy white clouds. The views out across the lake were stunning. I drove slowly while Eluvium and Ludovico Einaudi were our serene soundtrack to this wonderful place.

From Lecco it’s all highways back to the airport, we returned the car, flew home, then drove home on the left. Our escape to Italy for Christmas was over, and tonight we slept soundly in our own beds, Conway especially pleased to see his beloved cot and soft toys.
