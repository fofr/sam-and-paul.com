After 2 wonderful weeks volunteering with Wildlife Act in [iMfolozi](/2016/09/imfolozi-south-africa/) I started my next 2-week stint with them, weeks 7 and 8 of a [12 week trip](/tag/wildlife-act/). Leaving iMfolozi, and heading out of Mtubatuba, I was taken north. A 2 hour drive on a minibus, stopping for a night in Zululand Rhino Reserve before continuing for two more hours, through Jozini, across its dam, and up to [Tembe Elephant Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tembe_Elephant_Park), right on the Mozambique border. My time here is also part of Wildlife Act’s “[Endangered Species Conservation](http://wildlifeact.com/volunteer/south-africa/endangered-species-conservation/)” project.

My volunteer group was 5 people, this time they were older; from oldest in iMfolozi I was now youngest, yet I stayed the responsible one with the emergency volunteer phone. I was joined by Lynn and Peter – two travelling companions from New Jersey, a zoologist and an entomologist specialising in mosquitoes; Lindsey, from Houston, US, and Joris, a dutchman who I’d share a cabin with. Our monitor was Hayden, a friendly and contemplative young guy; he's a natural around animals. Occasionally we had elephant sessions with Leonard too, or ‘Leo’, a talkative guy, he loves to make or fix stuff, and he’s head of research here.

Tembe Elephant Park is very different to iMfolozi. Gone are the umbrella acacias and red dirt, they’re replaced with a unique and protected [sand forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_African_Sand_Forest), growing from ancient sand dunes. The roads are made of sand, a sandy channel lined with trenches carved from the wheels of 4x4s. It’s like driving on a beach and four-wheel drive is essential, when leaving the confines of these trenches even the trucks slip and slide in the sand.

Lining the roads are rare and endemic sand forest species; like hardwood lebombo wattle (newtonia) trees, beautiful pod mahogany’s that grow up and out to create giant natural parasols and grey-barked false tambouti trees – bare at this time of year, save a few straggling yellow and green leaves. It all combines to create a picturesque palette of yellow, white and green; a landscape photographer’s dream – if only they could leave the vehicle and not get eaten.

Tembe was set up to protect suni (a type of tiny antelope), sand forest, and elephants fleeing civil war in Mozambique. It’s a smaller park than iMfoloze, and as volunteers we were more involved with some of the park’s management.

## Wildlife Act volunteer camp

The camp here is almost luxurious when compared to iMfolozi. There's power all the time, and there’s water too. The camp is for research; there are 5 wooden cabins each with two beds, a wardrobe and air-conditioning. It’s got aircon! There’s a large communal kitchen that doesn’t get too hot, a lounge-like area with very old garden furniture, an old TV and VHS player, and outdoor benches.

Two green bulbuls own the overlooking trees; they’re tame and are happy to come and eat from your hand, or take a bath besides you – sometimes they thief food too; Peter had cheese whipped from his hand. These birds have a taste for cheddar it seems. Sunbirds also frequent the flowers.

We also get the odd herd of nyala antelope passing through. They don’t mind us too much, and we can fill up the bird bath to attract them over. A mother and daughter were common visitors, and an inquisitive male watched me hang up laundry. Besides the washing line we also found a collared sunbird nest. This place has a washing machine, no hand-washing required, unlike other reserves. On the rooftops we could find vervet monkeys scuttling away – we were careful not to leave food or valuables out that they might pinch. There’s a shy squirrel that nips about the trees too. The camp is fenced with high-voltage electrics, to keep out the elephants.

## Day 1 – Thrown in at the deep end

### The wild dog situation

We left Zululand Rhino Reserve early, and got to Tembe by 10am. Leo greeted us and showed us to our rooms. Hayden was out on patrol with two vets, trying to find a wild dog.

A pack of wild dogs had been consistently escaping the reserve. Fences built on sand are not difficult to circumvent if you’re a pack of dogs that loves to dig, especially when there’s incentive to get out and find food. Lions are dominating all the top hunting areas. When they escape they create problems in the community, with reports of livestock deaths – the park has had to pay out compensation, and the community has had enough; the dogs must go.

Cue a project to catch the entire dog pack and move them out to another park, probably one in Botswana. But catching wild dogs isn't easy, even if one of them is collared and can be tracked. It certainly can't be done in 3 days, the original timeframe.

A [call-up](http://wildlifeact.com/blog/predator-call-up-wildlife-conservation/) is what parks do to catch game; a bait is set, the scent is spread and some dying animal noise is played – "calling up" the wild animals so they can be darted.

Before we arrived one of the dogs had been caught, and when the last volunteer group were here they used nets in a call-up to catch three more – though the collared dog, Elsa, had to be released to rejoin the pack so they could all be tracked. All but one of the dogs was then caught the night before we arrived; 5 dogs were now in the [boma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boma_(enclosure&#41;), and only the collared dog Elsa was still in the park.

This included a single puppy. The dogs had been denning, but weren’t successful, and all but one of the new pups had died. The puppy was caught by hand by one of the vets. Hayden was out when we arrived trying to dart the last dog, Elsa the collared one; he wanted to finish the job while the vets were around. She didn’t play ball, her signal couldn’t be found and no darts were fired. The vets were staying in one of the cabins, they had one more night to try.

This dog project played an integral part in our volunteer duties; we'd visit them every morning and night to check on them, to check that they hadn’t escaped, that there were so signs of an escape attempt, to check that holes they’d dug were filled in, and to try and habitualise the dogs (both in and out of the boma) to further call-ups – by providing bait which had no negative consequence for them. This would make catching Elsa easier and when it came to transfer day, the dogs in the boma could be more easily darted.

Hayden arrived and introduced himself, he looked tired; these guys are all working extremely hard to sort out these dogs. There was an unused leg of nyala in the truck.

### Elephant session with Leo

Leo took us out at 11am for our first Tembe session. We travelled at snail’s pace, stuck behind a driver struggling with his 4x4 in the sand. He turns left, we speed up and search for elephants.

We find our first elephant bull standing besides the road, nonchalantly pulling branches off a tree. We stopped close; in iMfolozi I’d have been worried, but the elephants here are different, they seem, on the whole, calmer and of a nicer disposition. It also helped being with Leo, he knows the elephants, he knows how grumpy or curious they can be. We pass him and continue to the hide.

Mahlasela hide looks over a natural waterhole that’s artificially pumped with water during drought. It’s [streamed live on a web cam](http://tembe.co.za/web-cam/). There are elephant bulls drinking and frolicking in the mud, small herds of nyala cautiously approach to drink, storks hang around at the edges. On our way out we pass the elephant again, and a group of young giraffe who stare at us inquisitively.

### Collaring a lion

When we arrived Hayden said there’d be a lion call-up tonight. For a lion call-up you need a covered vehicle – lions mustn’t associate humans with food – that way people die and lions get shot. Hayden was trying to get us one. I was nervous it wouldn’t happen, or that we’d miss it; we missed out on a similar one in iMfolozi for those reasons, I tried to keep my expectations in check. By the evening everything was sorted and the call-up was on. It’d be all 5 of us, our monitor Hayden, Leo, a vet and two trainee vets.

The lions were seen near the hide; we would set up the bait nearby and wait there until they’d fed and been darted, then we’d go down and watch the vets do their thing. That’s if the lions took the bait and all went to plan.

The bait was a dead male nyala. It’s lucky none of us were vegetarian. This got a bit grim. From the back of the truck we dragged out the carcass and tied it to a pole with chains. Two metal screens were put up on either side, forcing any feeding animal to look away from the trucks – it makes darting them easier and safer. To spread the scent Hayden gutted the nyala, tied the guts into a neat ball, chained them to a truck and dragged them around the roads near the hide; this would hopefully tempt the lions in. Quite the first impression.

Leo stood guard with his rifle; getting off the truck is dangerous, and when people are on the ground working someone needs to be on lookout. We scanned for lions with the telemetry to double check none were close.

With the bait ready Leo got out his homebrew speakers which we hooked up to the car battery. It would play some very loud noises of a dying wildebeest. We left for the hide.

3 hours we waited; day turned to night, animals came and went. The night was warm, and the hide was comfortable.  The whining painful noise of the dying wildebeest blasted out, it died over and over again. Without warning three lions appeared; a female and two sub adult males. Every 40 minutes or so the dying wildebeest track gets paused; it stops so vets can have a break from the audio torment, right now it wasn’t playing. Leo radios in, and the track kicks back on - the wildebeest is dying again. All three lions look up, they stop what they’re doing, and leave; they know this means an easy meal and they leave on a mission. From the hide we wait patiently, we need the lions to take the bait, one needs to be darted and the others need to flee.

A radio call; a sub adult was darted. We’re on our way. We rush back to the truck and clamber in, now we’re back at the bait site, pulled-up alongside the trainee vets, engines off, lights off. One sub-adult male was darted, but we can’t begin because the others came back; Hayden and the vet are nearby.

In the dark of the covered truck we wait nervously, windows open. There’s a flash, another dart shot; through the trees we see only the headlamps and brake-lights. What’s happening? Then a radio; success, two sub-adult lions darted, the female mother has fled.

It takes 10 minutes for the sedative to take affect. Leo and the trainee vets bring the sleeping lions over on the back of a truck. We’re in a wide open space, no animals can ambush us here. With the two lions on the ground, their eyes covered by a cloth, we drive all three trucks around them, boxing them and us in – for safety. Lights on, engines running; if anything comes our way we can make a speedy getaway.

Time to act; against the whirr of the diesel engines and under flashlight the vets begin. We get out and watch. At any time two of us keep lookout, rotating high powered beams, inspecting bushes for cat’s eyes, listening out for elephants. Leo clutches his rifle. Meanwhile the vets administer antidotes for the dart sedatives, they take blood and hair samples to test for diseases, check the cats’ health, and prepare a collar. Every now and then a vet taps each lion’s ears, looking for reflex responses, making sure they aren’t waking up.

The lions are huge, their paws as big as my head, their body’s weigh over 200kg. I put my hand on their warm belly and feel them inhale and exhale, their fur is wiry. What an unbelievable experience. Us volunteers stand in awe, trying not to get in anyone’s way, thankful simply to be here, shining torches when the vets need more light.

"The mother is watching us", in the bushes a set of cat’s eyes. She’s hanging around, clearly concerned for her sons, but she doesn’t approach. It’s unnerving to be standing in the dark knowing there’s an anxious lion watching you. But the work is wrapping up.

The collaring took half an hour; now one sub adult male has a GPS store-onboard collar, which also emits a VHF radio _beep_; we can track this pride’s movement and find them with telemetry. Job done. We head for home, its been a long but incredible day. Hayden and the vet stay with the lions; to make sure nothing happens while they sleep, and that they wake safely. In the morning we’d try and track them.

## Day 2 - Our first trip to the boma

On an overcast morning the focus returns to dogs. The vets and Hayden go out early, one last attempt to find and dart Elsa – the whole pack would be in the boma. She’s elusive again, she hides and now the vets need to leave.

### Frisky bulls and peat bog

Our first session of the day was with Leo; our first stop is the hide. A different scene now – a mass gathering of male bulls around the water. They’re playing, drinking, bathing, spraying mud over themselves with a flick of their trunks. The nyala are still here, storks too, some duiker brave the trip to quench their thirst, and some aggressive little Egyptian geese fight anything that enters their territory.

A particularly large bull is feeling frisky, and he seems to like another male that’s here too – he gets the wrong idea and gives chase, looking to mate. The small bull flees, doing everything he can to indicate that he too is a male (I'll leave that to your imagination). They perform this odd dance, as one tries to mount, the other rotates, both escaping and demonstrating.

We leave the bulls and continue on our tour of the park. A black-chested snake eagle flies across in front of us, then a purple-crested turaco nips by – its mohican clearly visible. In front a yellow-throated longclaw makes us wait.

Tembe has a peat bog; over thousands of years layers of mud have formed, "1mm per year" Leo tells us. It's a protected and rare habitat, infuriatingly it’s on fire. It’s been on fire for over a year. The fire wasn’t intentional – something burning outside the park spread to the bog, and from there it’s never been put out. When it was small enough to douse, not enough was done. The smell of burning peat, a little like burnt clutch, fills this part of the park. At times the smokes gets so thick you can’t drive through it.

Animals still graze here; some of Tembe’s few grazers can be found near the bog – we see a pair of zebra, one ready to "drop" a foal; and a herd of buffalo.

As we travel through the park we pass herds and herds of nyala. They’re everywhere and there’s too many. At least a sixth of the population must be culled. Elephants clear out the sand forest, keeping the forest sparse and letting plants grow anew – it’s an important process. However when they’ve left the nyala come in, and they finish the place off; chewing away all the undergrowth that the endangered suni need for cover.

That said, we never really tired of seeing nyala. They are gorgeous animals; the male and female so starkly different – one dark brown with horns, the other tawny, both with a pretty band of white across their nose, the females with white stripes on their backs – like icing dribbled over a cake.

Against the overcast skies the springtime yellow and green sand forest is picturesque. On the sandy roads we pass timid grey and red duiker, then slow when we find an elephant. It’s a breeding herd.

Being besides a breeding herd is more perilous than a single elephant. Without warning you can be boxed in, with elephants blocking all exits – in those situations you need to wait it out; then all it takes is one curious or angry elephant and you and the truck are done for. Of course the females are with young too, an extra reason for them to get upset.

As the herd pass us, moving in front and behind, at times just a few metres away, we stay extra quiet. We mustn’t make ourselves big – no GoPro selfie sticks pointing out of the vehicle – it might be interpreted as a sign of aggression. Camera’s mustn’t beep, they don’t like the artificial sounds. We try not to move, and we duck down in the back, keeping ourselves small to avoid giving any wrong impression.

Over half an hour the herd passes us without incident, mothers and calves looking at us then continuing, an exhilarating if not frightening experience.

### To the boma

At 4pm we had our first session with Hayden. Like iMfolozi, he showed us [how to use the telemetry](/2016/09/imfolozi-south-africa/#Telemetry). We use the receiver, one that’s significantly better than iMfolozi’s, to find locations for collared lions; Kampa, Nyanga and our newly collared boy – M90. We find signals quickly, and that’s enough to confirm they’re all in the park.

At the site of the lion call up the dead nyala still rests. Chained to the metal fences it’s been nibbled at by the lions, they must have come back – a good sign that the experience hasn’t negatively influenced them. There’s still meat left, we leave it a while longer. Flies are already everywhere.

Now our first trip to the wild dog boma. The first of many. The boma is the size of a small football pitch, it’s divided into two and surrounded by a metal fence. Lining the inside and outside are electric fences – protecting what’s inside from elephants, preventing what’s inside from getting out. There are two gates to drive in, each with an airlock like system to stop anything escaping.

When we arrive all 5 adults are in their half of the boma, but the puppy has escaped to the other side. Being so small it can simply pass through the holes in the gate. It runs left and right, moving awkwardly, its back left leg damaged somehow. In the boma it should have time to rest, if only it would stay in one place.

We perform laps of the boma, driving round to check for holes and fence damage then return home; I cook us all a shepherd’s pie and we call it a night.

## Day 3 - Boma, boma, boma

If Hayden looked worried when we couldn’t find the puppy last night, then today his look was one of despair; when we arrived at the boma to check on the dogs we found that the puppy had escaped. “You let your puppy leave!”, Hayden says angrily to _Poofy_, its mother and the pack’s alpha female.

When we scan for Elsa we get a strong signal; her weak collar tells us she’s nearby, and as we do our boma circuit we find more evidence – there’s a fresh nyala carcass; she’d made a kill right beside the boma, presumably using its electric fence to help. Yellow-billed kites circle above it. We can only hope that the puppy is in her care.

When Hayden is thinking he’s very quiet; he leaves the truck and does an internal check of the boma, walking around looking for holes, looking for tracks, looking for places the puppy might have escaped. Trying to piece together the events of the night. He finds tracks by the gate; the story becomes clear; the gate’s fence holes were too large and the puppy could slip through them.  Overnight the electrics had gone down, giving the pup enough time to squeeze through two gates and hop two layers of electric fence.

We wait in the back of the bucky as Hayden plays Sherlock, a leg of nyala sits with us – feed for the dogs, we’d picked it up from the butchers. Now the yellow-billed kites are circling us. Have you ever seen Hitchcock’s “The Birds”? They perform a beautiful aerial show; swooping, squabbling and fighting with each other in the air, like a _dog fight_. Each of them has its eye on our fresh meat, we were confident they wouldn’t touch it with us sitting so close. We were wrong; one kite flies low, passes the front of the truck, then swoops down, brushing my shoulder and grabbing a talon-full of meat; in one sweeping motion it comes down, grabs the food, and rises again, never landing. I’ve had seagulls steal my tuna sandwich before, but this was a wild bird of prey. Astonishing.

We brought with us a leg, but Elsa had kindly left us a convenient fresh carcass. We loaded it into the truck and took it into the boma for a feed. Even though the pack are in the boma, we continue with the habitualisation – on moving day it will make things easier; Hayden chains the carcass to a tree and we drive away; all 5 dogs rush in and feed frantically. With the truck we try and get close, edging ever closer, getting the dogs comfortable with our presence.

Hayden’s patrol revealed signs of fresh digging, presumably the adults wanted to join the puppy on the other side and had renewed incentive to dig beneath the fence. We grabbed some heavy logs from the road side and filled all the dog’s trenches. No doubt they’ll try again.

On wednesdays it’s shopping day in Tembe; we returned to camp early. Our evening session was similar; we scanned for lions quickly, then returned to the boma; checking electrics, checking for holes, watching for Elsa.

### Unexpected visitors

Back at camp Joris oven cooked some chicken; he makes the best chicken. There was a knock at the door. Outside, a man asking for Hayden. Hayden was at the boma – it was his night shift. His name was Theo, he was carrying a six-foot rock python. The snake was injured, he’d found it on the road and was attempting to save it – there were some faint signs of life but it soon died, its injuries too severe; it had been run over, they left it in the truck. Theo, partner and son were staying over; Theo it turns out runs all the gun training exercises and tomorrow Leo had a session with him.

Next morning the truck was still outside the kitchen, the snake however wasn’t. It had survived, and was now slithering around camp somewhere, we followed its tracks in the sand for as far as we could.

## Day 4 - Lion cubs at sunrise

Today was a scorcher, with temperatures climbing into the thirties. As per usual, our morning session began with a trip to the boma; just a couple of laps looking for holes and tracks, then we left in search of lions. The dogs have priority, but Tembe has a lot of lions, and they need monitoring too. Many of the prides are collared, but lots of them are up north, out of reach.

From the boma we headed East, out toward the smokey peat bog. We didn’t get far, amidst the still smoke, an elephant in the road. He stopped feeding and began to walk our way;  we backed up, as you should, giving it more room. It kept heading towards us, not fast, not angrily, just pacing gradually in our direction, using the road as a path. Hayden reverses some more, and the elephant turns off, taking a well-trodden game path into the bush. My adrenaline was ready to kick in. We resume our search for lions.

The road from the bog turns North, and we followed it up towards Ponweni hide, using telemetry to gauge our distance from the lions. In the sandy road, fresh tracks; “lion!”, a lioness was in front, sitting on the roadside. With her, two nervous four month old cubs. The sun was just rising, and its early light cut through the forest, illuminating them beautifully. This female often travels with her sister, and it wasn’t longer before we found her too, and with her – more cubs. This was the first confirmed visual of these cubs; we counted 4, about 2 months old. Through the silvery tree branches they watched us. We stayed with the lions for half an hour, until they vanished in the foliage.

We had coffee and rusks at Ponweni hide then returned to camp.

### Busy waterholes

It wasn’t long before we were out on the road again. Leo’s elephant session began at 10:30am, just enough time for peanut butter on toast and scrambled eggs. A staple Tembe diet. These midday sessions, about 4 hours long, can be tough in the heat; with little shade and the sun bearing down, we needed plenty of water. So too do the elephants, and that makes the waterholes the place to be.

We return to Ponweni, passing swallows at the peat bog, a lone zebra pair and a southern banded snake eagle. Here, a few elephants rolling in the mud, a small breeding herd cooling themselves down with the thick black stuff, their trunks picking up gallons of it and spraying it all over themselves. It looked pleasant. Around the hide sunbirds danced amongst the boer-bean. The family soon left, their backsides coated in mud. The hide now empty, we left for our next stop.

As expected, the nearby waterhole was a flurry of activity. Hamerkops and herons were fishing in the water, and a breeding herd were drinking. Crested guineafowl marched about the place. Great herds of nyala and impala were by the water’s edge. This was the Africa I’d seen on TV; a waterhole overflowing with wildlife. Baby elephants sloshed in the water, in the shade of their elders, adults had minor scuffles, kicking up dust and knocking tusks. A kite found a gap for itself, a safe place to drink from.

From the back of the waterhole, a great elephant appeared. Elephants are big, and I thought I’d seen big elephants. This male was a monster. Twice the size of a small female, he was a tusker. A tusker is an elephant whose tusks weight more than 100lbs, or 45kg. He was the third largest in Tembe, and the biggest I saw on my whole trip. Leo positioned the truck so he’d walk right by us, a beautiful and powerful creature.

Black label lager was the perfect antidote to the heat, which we drunk while observing a little orange-bodied spider we couldn’t ID.

### Working at the boma

Our long hot day was topped off with a session of physical labour at the boma. With shovels, rocks, bricks and wood we returned to fill in all the holes the dogs had dug; fill them proper – plugging the big gaps with hard to move objects and throwing sand on top. We worked clockwise around the boma, 6 of us shovelling and digging, the truck shielding us from view of the dogs. We paid careful attention not to touch the electrics ourselves, a single jolt would be extremely painful.

Cleaning out the water trough was the dirtiest job, these dogs are filthy, meaning they don’t mind pissing and shitting into their water supply. We were literally shovelling shit, but it needed to be done. The smell was unimaginable.

While waiting for the night guard to take over boma-watch, we got a sighting of Elsa; she was running outside the far end of the enclosure. What’s more, the puppy was with her; it was alive and being looked after, though still hobbling.

At camp we cooked spaghetti bolognese, while peculiar looking [assassin bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduviidae) nymphs walked on our kitchen table.

## Day 5 - Driving north

My favourite excursion during the my 2 weeks in Tembe was this trip up north. We needed to change some camera traps, scan for lions, and pick up some gear from the northernmost outpost. That meant a 4am start, thankfully the weather was fair, some stars sparkled as we left and the moon shone brightly. It’d be a long drive, once we’d checked the boma.

The entirety of the north is closed to visitors, no tourists can drive the route we were taking. The roads are few; a single circuit goes up the West side, and comes down the East; the animals have at least some wilderness without humans. This part of the reserve looks different; there’s rolling hills covered in grass, broken by the occasional copse. Giraffe gather amongst the small groups of trees, and in the morning sunshine the view looks magical.

It was in this open grassland that we came across two uncollared lions; two sub-adults, siblings, they’d recently left their mother and were hunting on their own. They hadn’t been seen for months. The female sat on the road, legs out, perched like a dog. Her brother was harder to see, lying down in the long grass, his yellow fur making the perfect camouflage. His mane looked like a stylish teenage haircut. They noticed us, but soon turned their gaze to the herd of giraffe. Were they really stalking giraffe?

The lioness joined her brother in the grass, lying down, they watched the giraffe intently. Hayden drove us closer, giving us a fabulous view of the two. The giraffe noticed them, the group of six stared, always keeping an eye on their would-be hunters. We could have stayed with them all day, were it not for all the things we needed to do and the long drive ahead of us. We left them, as they wandered off in the direction of the herbivores.

We continued driving through the grasslands, past herds of wildebeest and the occasional grey duiker. I saw too the only reedbuck on my entire trip, a young’un and a goofy looking female with a white patch on her head. Zebra looked picturesque strolling amongst the long grass and leafless trees.

It was while driving, while I was scanning for lions, that Hayden swerved and stopped suddenly. He moved to avoid crushing a dung beetle and its great big ball of elephant dung. This flattened giant dung beetle was using its hind legs to roll dung along the road, while its mate waited patiently on the ball, spinning upside down as the sphere rolled. We’d seen dung beetle flying; they’re enormous and you wouldn’t want one to hit you while driving, it’d give you a black eye – Hayden knows this from experience. It was nice to see one up close, doing that thing their famous for.

At the Muzi borderpost we grabbed what we needed and sorted the camera traps, then it was time for coffee near the fence line. This edge of the park also happens to be a national border; we were looking into Mozambique, while sipping instant coffee. Two anti-poaching soldiers sat nearby, resting on a rock, rifles besides them. A little bee-eater perched on the barbed fence, and vervet monkeys ignored the national boundaries.

On the drive back we stopped to pick some [monkey fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garcinia); a hard skinned pulpy fruit; the animals love it, particularly the elephants. Nyala, impala and duiker were all loitering very close. We passed flocks of crowned hornbills; flying like a roller-coaster, up and down, up and down, their eyes are piercing – like they’re always annoyed at you.

After the 7 hour drive we enjoy the last remnants of the sunshine by the kitchen; some nyala drink from our water bath, we feed the tame bulbuls by hand and we shoo away the vervets. Forecast says storms.

The evening session was another trip to the boma; we scanned for Elsa, she was about, still hanging around, sticking with her pack. We had some bait with us to lure her out, but the skies were heavy, thick with cloud, and thunder rumbled in the distance. We stopped early when a bolt of lightning struck nearby – it’s not a good idea to stand on a truck holding a big metal aerial in a thunderstorm.

## Day 6 - When it rains, it pours

It rained overnight, but at 4:30am it seemed dry. We set off toward the boma in our wet weathers, rucksacks in black bags; it’ll be fine if it rains, we tell ourselves. As we near the boma the rain starts, a light drizzle, but its cold, the wind is chilly, it’s an uncomfortable start and we sit on our hands to keep warm and dry.

At the boma the electrics are down; something had shorted them overnight and drained the battery. Elsa’s been busy too, there’s another fresh carcass by the fence – she’s nearby, guarding her kill. We didn’t bring a bait with us, but this will do nicely. Hayden cuts off a leg, and we drive slowly around the fence, trying to get close to Elsa – the aim, to get eye contact then to drop the bait off the back, so she knows the food came from a truck – a mini habitualisation. Ideally we could use it to tempt her into the other half of the boma, currently vacant. We see her, we drop the leg and we drive away; it works, but Elsa and the puppy soon disappear into the thicket to eat it. It’s a start at least. The pup looks well. We give the rest of the carcass to the pack inside the boma.

Just as we’re done, and as we consider scanning for lions, the heavens open. Heavy rain drops pelt us, and Hayden sets off for camp. It’s freezing cold, and the water gets through everything; through the wet weather, through the coat; through the wet weather trousers and into my boots. The heavy rain forms channels of water as it runs off us, creating little puddles in all the crevices. It batters us, we’re soaked through, and cold to the bone, shivering. As we speed down the sandy roads, we stare downwards, the water too much to look up, water pours from our hoods, creating waterfalls from our noses. The short drive felt like an eternity.

The temperature doesn’t rise much above 15C all day – two days ago it was 30C; camp is cold, and the wet weathers struggle to dry. One cabin has a heater; we fill it with the wets and turn it on – hoping our warm clothes will dry out and we might have boots again tomorrow. We gather around the gas stove, hands out, trying to warm up as we make coffee.

It rained all day, and we never really got comfortable – camp isn’t designed for the cold. We didn’t go out on session again, though Hayden drove to the boma for a quick check before nightfall. The upside; this park really needed the water, about 13mm fell. I had rain again in my 8 weeks, but it was never this cold; I had a downpour that was heavier, but it was warm and almost enjoyable. Thankfully a cold rain shower like this happened just the once, and we weren’t far from camp.

## Day 7 - Tempting Elsa

At 5am this morning it was back to the boma. Thankfully our warm clothes had dried, it wasn’t raining, but it wasn’t warm either. At the butchers we picked up our bait, a frozen leg of nyala, “a meat popsicle”, Hayden called it, plus a fresh leg. At the boma we pick up a strong signal for Elsa and quickly find her.

We use one of the legs to tempt her out of the thicket – we drop it and keep driving; it kind of works, she emerges and grabs the whole thing but then disappears into the bush with it; the plan failed.

Plan B: Using the food we had for the rest of the pack, we attempt to tempt Elsa into the vacant half of the boma. We tie the leg to the back of the truck and drag around the sandy tracks, spreading the scent; we open up the gates to the vacant boma and leave the leg just inside. Maybe, just maybe, she’ll come out looking for the food and walk into the boma to get it. Maybe.

We waited for 1h30, to see what would happen. She paces up and down the edge of the boma, interacting with the pack. Her snout sniffs the air, she knows there’s a bait, she inspects the open entrance, stands at the doorway, meat in sight, sniffing the air. “Go in, go in!”, we whisper under our breath, all of us urging her to cross the boundary. She doesn’t, she’s too smart, whether she knows its a trap or she’s afraid of the electrics, she doesn’t go in, and we have to give up. We give the leg to the pack, saving it from the circling kites.

Back to lion monitoring; we scan for M90, Kampa and Nyanga, and we check on the old lion call-up bait. It stinks, the carcass is covered in maggots, but something has eaten most of it. The camera trap later reveals some lions snacking, and then 1,000 images of woolly necked storks.

With the rotten stench of death still fresh in our memories, we drove around to the edge of the hide’s waterhole to have coffee and rusks. A vervet monkey, perched precariously at the top of a leafless tree, eyed us nervously. Around the truck were fresh lion and porcupine tracks, and besides the water elephant and zebra were drinking. A lone wildebeest rolled around in a mud pit, clearly having way too much fun. A bateleur overhead doesn’t come close enough for pictures.

### Going west with Leo

Under cloud cover we left at 10:30am for our “ele” session with Leo. Elephants are known to head west after rain, but we found none – bar a breeding herd in the distance, too far to ID, they soon disappeared into the forest. A black-bellied bustard ran about in the long grass.

We stop besides one of the picnic sites for a break. One of the few designated spots tourists can get out – it’s no safer than anywhere else, but there is a re-assuring roped boundary; that’ll keep out the lions for sure. A giant ant queen meandered about in the sand while Leo told us stories about the hardwood newtonias and harder leadwoods, endangered trees – it’s illegal to cut them down, locals still do.

Not far from the picnic site, back on the sandy road looking for elephants, we inadvertently scare a huge crowned eagle. The bird had been feeding on its kill, we’d startled it, and the great bird of prey flew up in front of us and away into the distance. Leo records the sighting and makes a note of the kill; at first we fear its a suni, on closer inspection it’s a baby grey duiker. An impressive catch.

Our final stop is at Mahlasela hide. The waterhole is busy again; male elephants hug the edge; dipping in the water, bathing, drinking, feeding on the boer-bean. A particularly large bull is feeling frisky, and he seems to like another male that’s here too – he gets the wrong idea and gives chase, looking to mate. The small bull flees, doing everything he can to indicate that he too is a male (I'll leave that to your imagination). They perform this odd dance, as one tries to mount, the other rotates, both escaping and demonstrating.

In the tree tops and around the waterhole we watch collared sunbirds, marico sunbirds, african yellow white-eyes and cinnamon-breasted buntings. At the back a pair of southern black flycatchers swoop in and out of the tree, down to the water’s edge, picking up bugs. Above us, in the thatched rafters, our own bug – a large orb weaver spider emerged, black with yellow marks.

### No signs of Elsa

In the afternoon we wanted to try again with Elsa, we had our bait ready, but there’s no sign of her and we don’t pick up a signal. Hunting elsewhere perhaps? We hang around, watching the pack feed on the remains of a nyala, a pied crow braves it too.

It was a beautiful sunny evening, and now the sun was setting we headed out into the fields, scanning for lions. In this relatively flat area, “relatively”, most of Tembe is flat, it’s hard to get signal without getting up high. Getting up high means climbing trees; Hayden loves any excuse to climb a tree, and with the telemetry he skittled up the branches to the top, before any of us volunteers could decide whether to go with him or not. We couldn’t find the lions, but the sunset was superb.

## Day 8 - Disaster

It was such a beautiful morning. The cool night and the clear skies left a layer of mist over Tembe. It was crisp, dew drops glistened in the morning sun, it felt like a gorgeous winter’s morning.

Before the sun was up we quickly checked the boma. On route we found fresh lion tracks; M90s signal was nearby, this pride of 3 lions were near the dogs in the boma; we’d need to keep an eye on them. No visuals this morning though. At the boma itself, all looked well. We performed our laps, looking for tracks, signs of digging, checking on the dogs. No sign of Elsa, and no signal; it makes sense for her to up and leave if lions are nearby.

This morning we’d focus on lions too, and in the nearby grasslands I stood on the truck scanning for M90, M25, M26 and F70. And Elsa. I get a brief signal for Elsa, and through the murky mist, I think I see her, a fleeting glimpse of a dog.

In these grasses, mist all around, the sun poking through, it’s simply gorgeous. All the dew coated spider webs twinkle. Any animal whatsoever would create the most astounding photograph; but today they’re all hiding. Not even an impala graces us with its presence. It’s a morning of near misses; we find fresh leopard tracks, fresh rhino tracks, fresh lion tracks, fresh scat, porcupine trails, mongoose trails. Stonechats and puffbacks sing in the mist, but all the mammals are out of sight. As a photographer, in this light, I’m frustrated; the most picturesque session in all 8 weeks and the creatures don’t turn up. Joris suggests a coffee break, “we need to find some animals first”, Hayden replies. I get a single sighting in the mist, a male kudu turns to look at us and I grab a photo.

Soon the sun is too high and the mist burns off; we stop at Ponweni hide for refreshments. A burchell’s coucal sings in the distance, a “liquid, bubbling ‘doo-doo-doo-doo’” sound, descending in scale. Hayden’s favourite. When it’s time to leave, after walking back to the truck, we find more fresh lion tracks, this time they’re over our tyre marks, heading back to the hide. When we return a male and female lion are drinking; we must have walked right past them. A slender mongoose runs out in front of us when we leave, and we spot a black-fronted snake eagle.

### Disaster

On our way to camp we swung by the boma. We wanted to get a visual on Elsa, and we needed to check the location of the nearby lions. If they get too close to the boma they could spook the dogs. At the gate the electrics are fine, the lions are nearby but don’t seem to have come closer. Suddenly Hayden curses and leaps out of the truck; there’s dog tracks by the gate.

The tracks come from the boma, they come from the gate and out past the electrics.  The dogs have escaped. The gate has been dislodged, pulled back by the dogs, breaking an old lock and creating a gap just big enough to squeeze through. There’s one spot where the electrics have a weakness, it’s by this gate – trucks and people enter and exit here – there’s a small gap. The dogs walked through the gate, walked through the doorway for people – bypassing the electrics, and hopped through the surrounding ground electrics, mostly there to stop elephants getting in.

But inside the boma there were still 3 dogs, the three yearlings were digging by the gate. They hadn’t fathomed they could walk out through the gap. The pack’s alpha male and female – Finn and Poofie, were long gone. “The worst dogs to escape”. They’d hightailed it with Elsa and the puppy sometime during our session.

A moment of utter despair. We’d been so close, so close to getting the last dog, Elsa, into the boma. “It will take weeks to get them back”, Hayden says. Now we were so far, the goal almost unattainable. Within 12 hours the dogs had escaped the reserve too. We never saw the puppy again.

### Evening at the lodge

Our evening session was a simple one; we returned to the boma and double checked everything. From the perimeter, truck wheels resting on a bone pit, fish eagles in the trees, we watched the sunset.

Despite events of the day, we’d planned a group meal at Tembe’s tourist lodge. A three course meal. We sat around a campfire with drinks, then shared a meal of carrot soup, chicken with petit pans, and poached pear for dessert. I took Hayden’s recommendation and had a very good milkshake. The sombreness of the day overlooked, for now.

## Day 9 - Going climbing

Today I spent most of the day on the truck. The weather had turned from the cold rain on Sunday to a scorching new heatwave. Mercury rising above 30C again. This is also where our sightings dried up; despite our best efforts, and our monitoring, we wouldn’t see another lion. Today we scanned for M90, that pride had left the boma but were in the vicinity, sleeping somewhere no doubt. Ponweni hide was quiet, save a troupe of banded mongoose that ran besides us on our way there.

We weren’t picking up much on the telemetry – we needed bearings. This meant a little excursion out to a tall concrete signal tower. To get to the top, set in the concrete blocks and going way up high, a metal ladder – a couple of rungs bent or twisted. Hayden invited us to join him at the top of the makeshift construction. “Make sure you don’t put both hands on one bar, if it comes out you’ll fall”, that put Lindsey off. Peter and I braved it, Hayden practically ran up. At the top you need to manoeuvre from the ladder, through a protective barrier, and overcome any sense of sudden vertigo. But the views from the top are stunning – sweeping views of unbroken trees in all directions, out to Mozambique in the north, and south, back into KZN. We had coffee here and tried an overripe monkey orange.

On the drive back we stopped for a gorgeous bush-shrike – a rare appearance, this commonly heard bird is rarely seen, living in the thicket, it’s beautiful plumage often missed. For once this bird sat in a perfect spot, but not quite long enough for a photo; it’s one of those shots that exists solely in my mind. There was another stop too; crossing the sandy track was an eastern hinge tortoise, “first of the season”.

### Sweltering with Leo

Today was shopping day; Joris, Lynn and Peter went to Spar with Hayden while Lindsey and I went on session with Leo. I didn’t bring enough water, which was fine for the first 1h30 – we stayed at Mahlasela hide watching the activity around the artificial waterpool. Elephants played in the mud, play fighting most likely, but almost tusking out an eye. Nyala and waterbuck came to drink in the heat, as did a yellow-billed kite and a fish eagle – not to the liking of the egyptian geese.

From the hide the session continued out in the open sun, no shade, and no elephants. We were keen to get back, but we had an errand to run. Overnight an elephant had wreaked havoc on the parks’s water systems, finding a pump, destroying it, and drinking some of the 1,000s of litres that leaked from it. It was being fixed, but Leo and us had to tweak the main system pumps, which were deep in the park, along a management track. I’m glad I brought sun lotion, if not water.

### Back out with Hayden

No sooner as we had got back with Leo, Hayden and the group arrived with the shopping, and then we were back out on session, first to the boma, then out to search for the escapees – our satellite data told us they were in the reserve. From the butcher we picked up the stinkiest, greenest, foulest smelling leg of nyala – its stench was overwhelming, it sat in the back with us while we gagged.

At the boma the dogs were all fine, and we stopped in the evening light to photograph the beautiful little bee-eaters sitting on the lines above the dogs.

On the hunt for Elsa and the alpha pair we also scanned for M90, and came across a snake eagle sitting in the road. There too was a big male elephant, it seemed to be enjoying itself too much, making his own pleasure – if you understand. We didn’t find the dogs, we couldn’t get a signal for Elsa’s collar before it turned off for the night.

Under the clear skies and beautiful stars we returned the meat to the mortuary; an elephant was nearby, back at the site of the water pump, presumably trying to break it again to get more water. We were wary of it while we hosed all the blood off the bucky. The session had one last shock; when leaving the mortuary, in our newly cleaned truck, in the dark, we sped out and around the corner, to find ourselves faced suddenly with the rear of an elephant; a quick stop – brakes sending us flying forward, elephant rendering us silent. We were shocked, it was shocked; it went one way, we reversed, turned and went home the long way round.

## Day 10 - Searching for dogs

At 4:30am we left in search of those troublesome dogs. Stinky rotten leg in tow. As Hayden had done many times before, too many times, we drove out to the park fence-line and searched for them – attempting to do an habituation, a call-up, something to begin the process again of getting them close to a truck. The dogs, of course, needed catching again; this time a little more wary, a little smarter, it’d be more difficult. These habituations are essential for a successful dart and sedation.

Along the fence we searched for fresh signs of digging, and at every hole we plugged it with tree branches. Tracks in the sand showed us where they’d come and gone. We didn’t find the dogs, but we could see where moles had dug their tunnels and we came across fresh leopard tracks. I climbed through the electric fence to fill-in a fence hole and take a good look at these tracks – the closest I’d come to a leopard on my whole trip.

From the fence line we took a long and bumpy road out to a beacon. A lesser travelled part of the park, the small hills looked beautiful in the sunshine. We got a strong signal for F76 – a lioness, she likes to hang around here, but we didn’t see her. Besides the beacon there were fresh lion tracks; a big male. While scanning and having coffee we remained wary of possible un-collared lion in the area.

We saw black-collared barbets, a little goshawk, puffbacks clicked and whistled all morning, and green wood-hoopoes cackled in groups nearby. But the dogs were a no show. Besides the picnic site, their last known location, we left that stinky leg – we were all glad to see it go.

### Elephants in the mud

We all came on the hot midday session with Leo. This time I brought plenty of water. We drove East, out to the swamp in search of elephants. White-crowned lapwings walked in the sand, a white-bellied bustard ran away. At the bridge the lesser-striped swallows were catching flies.

We found lots of elephants; they were here at the swamps in their herds; taking turns to get in the mud, to roll around, to cover themselves in the thick black stuff, to cool themselves down. Under the bright intense sunshine, in awful photography conditions, the grey elephants looked jet black, under their fresh coats of mud.

At camp Hayden found a snake, but not one to be afraid of. It’s a thread snake, it fits snuggly on the palm of a hand and looks like a metal necklace. It’s amazing.

### Still no sign of the dogs

Our 4pm session focused on finding these dogs. Satellite data told us their rough locale; we’d yet to pick up a signal for Elsa and we needed to find them. With Hayden we returned to the fence line, no signal again. At the picnic site, the leg untouched, no signal. At the fence line, no tracks, no signal. The dense thicket must be blocking the collar’s weak signal.

Parked up by the fence, Hayden and I headed out into the long grass with the telemetry, out to the tallest tree, which we’d climb; Hayden scanned for Elsa from the top while I kept look out and checked for ticks. Probably not the best idea to walk through this long grass in shorts, eh? Still nothing.

On the way back a suni ran across the road, only Hayden saw it. At camp Joris cooked us his delicious oven-roasted chicken. Perhaps we’d have better luck tomorrow.

## Day 11 - A long day on the bucky

### Feeding wild dogs a fresh nyala

A short session this morning – a trip to the boma to feed the dogs. We had a fresh nyala this time, no stinky green leg; this one was merely bloody and tick-ridden. At the boma it was the usual; we undid the gates, drove in and used shovels to fill in the holes the wild dogs had made.

The dogs were hungry, they could smell the nyala, and while we shovelled sand they were less nervous around us, their hunger emboldening them, bringing them closer while we were on foot. Thankfully not too close. We lifted the dead antelope off the truck, chained it to the tree, and drove away; the dogs immediately ran in, tearing open the creature and going straight for the best bits. A liver is particularly tasty it seems. We photographed from the truck.

We did a short drive to look for lions, we scanned but couldn’t find any. There were though lots of crested guinea-fowls – all clucking together in unison; and a large rock monitor lizard who skulked along in the grass.

### Last session with Leo

The temperatures had dropped, and this overcast session would be more comfortable than the last. We started on Tembe’s western loop, driving from the water tank, around and up to Ponweni hide. A large martial eagle sat at the top of a pod mahogany, a young giraffe and mother watched us, there were lion tracks on the road. No elephants though, we didn’t find any until we reached the hide – a breeding herd, they were just leaving.

We continued East, down to the peat bog, past the swallows, the grey herons and the weavers. Buffalo rested in the swamp. Another breeding herd, in the distance, with a rowdy male – we watched him chase off a lesser bull.

At the waterhole, one more elephant – Mr McDonald his name. He was in must, we watched him cautiously while hamerkops, geese, kites and nyala drunk from the waterside. He drank, and sprayed, then walked in our direction, we swiftly left.

### Deafening audio of twittering dogs

In our attempts to find and habituate the escapees we employed a new weapon. This time we brought with us fresh bait and a speaker system; the same one we used for the lion call-up. I sat up-front with Hayden, and we drove out to the park’s fence line, once more hoping to find these dogs and begin the long process of catching them.

We’d use the speakers to play the loud noise of twittering dogs; if the pack hear it they should respond and investigate. The noise of other dogs may confuse them, using this audio isn’t something that’s done lightly.

Satellite data told us they were still near to the picnic site, where the smelly leg had been left. But once again, this short range low power collar, gave us no beeps. We drove around, up and down, scanning intensely, trying to find them. Nothing.

Cue the audio and the bait. Out into the thicket we blasted the squeaky deafening sounds of twittering dogs. A recording of happy dogs feeding on a bait, a microphone discreetly attached somewhere. Twitter, twitter, squeal; these ephemeral dogs didn’t bring out the real ones. We drove and tried elsewhere, still nothing. No beeps, no visuals; the once-a-day satellite data our only guide – at least they were in the reserve. This was getting frustrating. It rained on the way home.

## Day 12 - Camera traps and baits, and potjie

On our penultimate day we had rain again, great for the park, a little uncomfortable for us. At the boma the three yearlings were having breakfast, and a large owl flew by us. Our journey interrupted by a breeding herd of elephants blocking the road.

This morning we’d focus on lions – sort of; Tembe has so many lions that many of them are best monitored with nyala baits and camera traps. We had 4 to set up near ponweni hide, the baits themselves were already prepped; nyalas hung from a tree branch by their necks, sliced open and gutted, guts left on the floor.

At the hide we waited and waited for the rain to cease. Today the hide revealed little; no elephants, or birds, we waited with our coffee and rusks; the taste of the instant stuff warped a little by the thick minerals in Tembe’s water. Eventually we braved it, the drizzle was easing off.

We drove until we found each nyala bait; the hanging carcasses were hard to miss. 3 male and 1 female – a poor foetus sat beneath her, a miniature nyala with visible white stripes, it looked almost ready to start living. At each site we used a tree to tie-up a camera trap enclosure (string and nails), lined up the camera, set the camera trap, and primed the motion sensor. With every hammer into the tree trunk we’d get showered in drips. Elephants and lions have a habit of removing the traps, need to be securely fastened.

While doing all this I finally got the opportunity to photograph the gorgeous bush-shrike, the shot wasn’t as good as my imaginary one, but it’ll do. A juvenile martial eagle also graced the skies. The nyala, the living ones, all sheltered beneath the trees, shivering and wet.

On the way back we attempted to track lions, scanning for M25, M26, Kampa, Nyanga, F76. We didn’t catch a beep.

### Drama at camp

Overnight Lindsey had had trouble sleeping; she was woken in the night and could hear movement outside her chalet. She didn’t want to investigate by herself, but it sounded close – she was up most of the night.

Back at camp, after our session, we had a visitor. A large elephant bull walked along our perimeter. We’d just driven into camp, the gate was open; we all eyed the elephant nervously – it stood outside the camp, staring at us, looking through the open gate. If it came in it would be bad. After a tense few moments the “ele” moved on, and Hayden rushed to shut the gate.

There was one other exciting discovery; near the laundry we found what looked like a large pink worm squirming in the mud. It wasn’t quite a worm, but a worm snake. A mysterious reptile.

### Call-up failure

The dogs had moved. Satellite data showed them on the other side of the park. From the water tower we triangulated a rough position and headed down to find them. I was scanning, sitting in the front, doing my best to locate them. The signal was strongest at a crossroad – 2 bars, the first signal we’d had in days. The road was intersected by a well used game path – nyala and elephant tracks littered the scene, but we found dog tracks too. Tyre tracks suggested guides had been here earlier, they might have seen the dogs.

Elsa was at our 2 o’clock, we tied a fresh leg of nyala bait to a tree and set up the speaker system. How fresh? The animal was still a little warm, shot that afternoon. We began the deafening twitter noises, and it seemed to work – I scanned as we played, and the signal grew stronger, 2 bars, 4 bars, 6 bars. It was working. But they didn’t appear, perhaps they watched us from an invisible vantage, the signal quietened again, maybe it was just bouncing. We played the audio again, and again. They never showed up. But we were close. We left the leg there for them, chained, near to the road.

### Potjie

Pronounced “Poy-key”, tonight Hayden cooked for us. He made us a traditional potjie in a cast iron pan over an open fire (coals, not wood – you can’t burn the wood in Tembe – wood must decay and return to the sand over many years). With the potjie, a salad, corn meal, and cheese and onion toasties grilled on the fire. It was delicious.

## Day 13 - Successful call-ups

This morning, our last full day, we returned immediately to where we’d left the nyala leg. We had no fresh bait today. The leg was still chained to the tree, seemingly untouched, but fresh elephant and dog tracks were here too, over our truck’s tracks from last night. Hayden wondered whether the “ele”s had scared ’em off. We reverse away from the leg and set up the speakers, while Joris scans. A little twitter rings out, then we wait. Like before, they seemed closer, beeps were louder. We edge forward for a better view.

And there they were. The dogs, at long last, the 3 escapees – Elsa, Finn and Poofie, no sign of the puppy. At last a confirmed visual, after days of effort we could begin. When they saw us they looked to run; we reversed back, waited, and played the audio again. They returned to the meat, to finish their abandoned meal. While one fed the others were moving, always looking around, checking their surroundings. We edge closer, they skip away, we wait, they come back again, we repeat the process – each time getting closer, each time the dogs growing more accustomed to the presence of us and the truck.

### Courtship at camp, kudu burgers at the lodge

From the kitchen I heard a peculiar clicking and clucking noise, and the odd _whirrrr_. I traced the noise to a shrub outside. Peering in, I could see a bird sitting patiently on a branch, beneath her, another, a male – he danced heroically, clicking, whizzing and bouncing from tree to tree, trying to woo and impress her. They were green-backed cameraopteras, a pleasure to watch, though he wasn’t successful.

It was around now that Peter and I also started the great plover debate. How do you pronounce plover? Is it plover – like lover, or plover, like clover. Turns out we aren’t the only ones, and a quick Google revealed the same arguments online. We agreed to a British way and an American way on the way to the lodge for lunch.

Hayden had told us all about the kudu burgers; this was our last chance to try one. We booked a table for 6 and each of us had an accompanying milkshake. Samanga monkeys, crested guineafowl and nyala hung around the restaurant.

### Successful call-ups

After eating antelope ourselves, we left for another call-up session, a leg of frozen nyala bait in the back. On arrival we found their signal had moved, they weren’t near the crossroads, they’d headed further west, to the perimeter. On the border road we drive fast, passing herds of feeding elephants, closing down on the dog’s signal. We slow for a newtonia tree in the road, and stop to scan again.

Lynn scans, the signal is strong, 11, 12 o’clock she says. We look ahead, along the road, and here they are, coming our way. We drive towards them and they scatter into the grass, but they don’t go far, they’re watching us. Now for one of Hayden’s tricks; he asks Lindsey to watch them, to make eye contact with them, and while they’re watching, to drop the leg from the truck. The dogs know the meat came from us. We reverse and wait.

Cautiously they move-in, they grab the leg and drag it to a safer place. We follow them, taking the truck off road, over grass, bumps and rocks, to get close to them. We continue the habituation, keeping close, making them comfortable. Hayden revs the engine a little, a noise they shouldn’t be afraid of. We watch them feed, and in the long grass we have a photo opportunity; it was idyllic just watching them, in the dimming evening, our time in Tembe coming to an end.

We had to drive back along the border fence to get home. Some of those elephants we’d sped past were now much closer, one fed from a tree right besides the road. We needed to pass, this could be awkward. She was small… ish, and nervous. We move closer, carefully creeping forward, she’s not happy – she pulls back, lifts her leg and flaps her ears. We wait, unsure what she’ll do, wary of alarming her more. Then we creep closer still, trying to squeeze past, all of us silent. We’re almost clear, and she lets out a poot from her trumpet, but we’re clear now, and heading into the distance, hearts palpitating.
