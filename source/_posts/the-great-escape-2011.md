Festival season starts early in Brighton (or does it ever end?), and just a few days back from Madeira we took a little more holiday to enjoy our first festival together, The Brighton Great Escape. Three days spread across the city, with over 100 acts playing, I’d dedicated a good portion of the week to planning who to see, listening to festival playlists and discovering new music. 

We were joined by Sarah and Mark, travelling down from Bristol they arrived early on Thursday morning. After some coffee, fresh croissants and a lot of comparing schedules we started our festival. Sam was still working, so for now it was just the three of us.

At Jubilee square we picked up our shiny red weekend wristbands and searched for the Queen’s Hotel on the seafront. Luluc, Rhob Cunningham, Moddi and 22 were playing what we called the “morning session”, which ran from 12 ‘til 4pm. On a carpeted hotel room we caught the end of Luluc’s set; guitar and deep beautiful vocals, their track made famous by Grey’s Anatomy. Rhob Cunningham was up next, an irishman, his songs were stories with guitar and they were lovely. And between tracks he had stories too, seems he was attacked by a falling starfish when he arrived in Brighton. Moddi followed, a beautiful serene norwegian folk act with cello and accordion, this set turned out to be a festival highlight. The music so incredibly powerful and different from everything else on offer. With Becks and Corona in plastic beer cups, 22 took the stage, norwegian again but very very different - compared to Muse and The Mars Volta, they were an extremely energetic young band that liked to jump around and punch their fists through the ceiling, I can’t say we were overly impressed. The weird half-backwards-mohican the lead singer sported was entertaining however.

Ready for more music, we nipped into an alternative escape venue, the appropriately named “Live music bar”, to see Brother and Bones and Model Society perform. On the way back we were lucky enough to catch Cloud Control perform three songs, including my favourite, “There’s nothing in the water we can’t fight”, at Jubilee square.

Home for pizzas and back out again with Sam, we headed to St Mary’s church for the fat cat records event. Sat in the pews at the front, sipping wine (beer in a church feels awfully wrong), a stage with grand piano and projector was setup beneath the dim light of a chandelier and the dying stained glass sunlight. Dustin O’Halloran opened the show, with a gorgeous, deceptively simple piano composition, accompanied by a string quartet. It was  reminiscent of Ludovico Einaudi. Sitting a little awkwardly in the wooden seats, we watched Hauschka perform his peculiar strain of piano music, heavy on the obscure percussion and ending with ping pong balls being thrown into the grand, it was delightfully different. We spent most of the act trying to work out how he was making such incredible noises. In the dark now, all sunlight vanished, Max Richter culminated the show with a perfect rendition of his Infra album, complete with strings, he also played my favourite, “On the nature of daylight”. All in all an excellent post-classical event, and now onto something very different.

At 10:30 we arrived at the Pavilion Theatre (the Uncut stage) to catch the end of Babe,Terror’s (not “Baby torture”, I might add), improvised and very clever drone set, but consisting of a single man surrounded by fairy lights and humming into a mic occasionally, it wasn’t the most riveting viewing. I love this sort of music, but with the room filling up for Gang Gang Dance, the vibe wasn’t there. And then the main set, the reason we were here, the very loud and awesome Gang Gang Dance, playing their new album “Eye Contact”. With tribal drums, Kate Bush-esque vocals, and a flag waver, the gang dance kicked into full swing. It was phenomenal and I’ve had their albums on repeat ever since. In their vietcong hats they danced with us, and we went home, ears ringing, ready for two more days of awesome music.

Friday started with all four of us downstairs at Komedia, its dark wooden floor and low ceilings a stark contrast to the carpeted Queens Hotel. Oh So Quiet opened our proceedings, and we were dutifully impressed. The General played next, but they were trying too hard, and we left for “The Hope” venue to see a hung over Marina Gasolina play her entertaining female punk act, with its so very punk “I’m so hungover I’ve forgotten the words” moments. Great fun mind. We weren’t sure where to go next, but our well thumbed band guide told us about REBEKA, “polish electro acoustic lo-fi disco with Chinese techno and dirty synths”. Sold! Out to Horatio’s on the peer we headed, via the free chocolate stick stands. Out over the sea, REBEKA performed their phenomenal mix of beats and vocals, they were loving it, we were loving it, it was fabulous. Shame they didn’t have an album out, I’d have bought it instantly.

At the vietnamese place, Pho, for lunch, where we didn’t try the weasel shit coffee, we mixed our beers with noodles and spring rolls. And out again for the evening session, starting with Dan Parsons and his strand of Australian indie pop at Komedia studio. The Firestarter album made you want to dance, and the girls in front were loving it, so much so Dan rather unsubtly told us all where he was staying… . Onwards to the Uncut venue. Dean McPhee took the stage first, I already own his fabulous Brown Bear 12”, I bought it instantly after hearing the phenomenal Sky Burial track. A one man act, he showed us how astounding his guitar skills were, it gave me shivers, and I am eagerly anticipating his first album. Incredible haunting and complex sounds produced from a single guitar. We all sat to watch Trevor Moss and Hanna Lou, a quaint country act that grew on us as the set continued, really very pleasant. The guy we’d come to see though was Josh T. Pearson, a bearded giant, his soft grasping folk and guitar work stole the show, as did his between track jokes and wry humour, “what’s the difference between a musician and a large pizza? A large pizza can feed a family,” he joked, wearily. Despite being full, the venue was hushed and in awe, his presence all encompassing. “How good was that!?”, Mark exclaimed. The headliners were Villagers with their Frodo like lead singer. We all knew “Becoming a Jackal”, and soon day two of the festival was over. With some 1am chips we stumbled home.

Sam cooked up some brie and mango quesadillas for Saturday breakfast and sooner than we knew it bands were playing again! Down the hill again, past the station, to Komedia, upstairs this time for the canadian acts. Hey Rosetta! started our last day with jumping indie rock complete with cello and violin. They played tracks from their Seeds album and we all loved these guys. Young Empires came next, an energetic threesome with electronic beats, slightly camp but extremely danceable. On Kitsune they’re an act to keep an eye on though we missed their free CDs. Finally (and I mean finally, they took forever setting up), Braids performed their experimental dreamy electronic pop-rock fusion. With the venue brimming, it wasn’t to everyone’s taste, but I loved it and I’ve had the album, “Native Speaker,” on all week. Of course, they were the reason we were there.

We stopped at The House for dinner/lunch; yummy burgers, steak and fish pie refuelled us for our final evening of loud music and awesomeness. Down to the sea front and to Concorde 2\. Guitars, violins and synths in the form of Malpas began the night, but the bass was turned up too high, it was loud enough to shake your bones and restart your heart and it completely drowned out the music. Dry the River’s americana rock didn’t take my fancy, but it filled the floors and rocked the house. The Antlers came next, playing incredible haunting rock from their new album “Burst Apart”, so good we bought it straight away. The act that brought us in were Okkervil River, playing a full set, indie folk-rock tracks were hammered out back-to-back. The ripping harmonies of “Lost Coastlines” and “Our life is not a movie or maybe” had everyone in ecstasy, singing out loud, smiling and jumping. It was glorious.

To end the festival we strolled back along the sea front, past the pier, up to the Pavilion Theatre again where we caught the end of “The Secret Sisters”. This country gospel twosome from Alabama was incredibly American and incredibly quaint, yet somehow it all just worked, even with a ghost on stage messing with the mic. Alela Diane played out our festival with her warm vocals and americana, with an encore to boot.

And that was that, our legs ached, our heads ached and we were very very tired. But wow, 30 very very good bands in 3 days (and our plans avoided all the queues!). Such high quality awesome performances and with such variety. From Chinese techno to Norwegian folk, we’ve found and experienced some truly incredible new music. When can I buy my tickets for next year?

Fittingly we devoured a full English breakfast on Sunday, and after Sarah and Mark left we wasted the day watching rubbish movies.

I’ve created a Spotify playlist of the acts we saw, in the order we saw them. Some artists aren’t on Spotify, namely REBEKA, and some have only singles not albums, but the playlist still captures the diversity of the festival. I urge you to check it out.
