Our trip to Funchal, Madeira wasn’t planned, and it came about through the circuitous route of a cancelled 3 week holiday in Japan, but that’s another and much less exciting story. Booking last minute, we opted for a one week Thomson (TUI) package, with flights and hotel included, which is very unlike us. But we needed a holiday, had to book it fast and it had to be somewhere hot, not too expensive and interesting; Madeira fit the bill perfectly.

<!--more-->

The Thomson flight landed on a Friday evening, the plane bouncing once on the runway which juts out into the sea, raised up on its enormous stilts. The balmy English weather we had over Easter was much the same as Funchal’s, a hot sun with a cool wind. Madeira’s peaks rose up and were topped with thick cloud.

A brief coach transfer took us to our hotel, Vila Vicencia. Through tunnels, over concrete bridges and deep valleys and into Funchal, with its whitewashed houses and terracotta rooftops. Hotel tower blocks stood tall in the distance, as the buildings dotted themselves over the hilltops, petering out as the roads continued upwards and inland.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-030-cable-car-view.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-030-cable-car-view.jpg)

We stayed, rather unsurprisingly, in the [hotel zone](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2796858-10780389?url=http://www.hotels.com/de1072741/hotels-funchal-portugal/ "Hotels.com in Funchal"), but Vila Vicencia was very different to its surroundings. A set of three converted houses, it’s a hidden gem amongst the monsters. Surrounded by tightly packed luscious gardens and with a quaint, timely and sun bleached decor, it ekes out its own slice of personality amongst the faceless. It’s certainly not five or even four star, but it’s small enough to know the other guests and to make friends.

The room was for three, and we enjoyed the extra space of a living room and balcony. Wooden wardrobes and creaky beds contrasted the flat screen TV. We brought our own tea, we knew we would have a kettle, and a fridge for the milk.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-002-vila-vicencia.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-002-vila-vicencia.jpg)

Acquainted and unpacked we headed into Funchal for our first night, albeit a little chillier than expected. We passed the [famous Reids hotel](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2796858-10780389?url=http://www.hotels.com/ho141078/reids-palace-funchal-portugal/ "Hotels.com") and the kitschy Casino. The restaurants were all very similar, clearly geared towards tourism, many had resorted to our most hated of things; restaurant touts, not to mention menus with poorly photographed pictures of meals. Very unsure of ourselves, and starving, we stopped at the first place with a bit of character and a menu that detailed dishes; Chalet Vicente.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-142-chalet-vicente.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-142-chalet-vicente.jpg)

Unaware that portions here were gargantuan, we ordered mains and starters and ploughed into a garlic bread that could have served four. One of Madeira’s many specialties is Skabbard (Espada), a deep sea fish caught in only a few places worldwide, it is served with locally grown banana and passion fruit. The sweet fishy combination is particularly tasty. And every meal seems to come with potatoes and boiled vegetables, whether its appropriate or not.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Fish soup served in bread
*   Local meat soup
*   Skabbard with banana and passion fruit, served with boiled potatoes and vegetables.
*   Deer with a red wine sauce, mushrooms and a red bean and rice stew
</div>

Finishing up our bottle of house red, we were stuffed and intoxicated, and we stumbled home to our nearby hotel with its firm but comfortable beds.

<!--nextpage-->

Up in time for the 8 - 10am continental breakfast (the staple slice of toast, sliced cheese, meat slices, eggs and cake, with tea and some sort of coffee), we spent Saturday finding our feet.

Madeira is colourful and filled with crazy flora. The roads down to the centre of Funchal were lined with beautiful trees in a purple blossom, and preparations were already starting for the flower festival which we’d miss by a couple of days.

We stopped at the grassy Carlton Park overlooking the Marina before walking down to the commercial district. Funchal is broken up by roads and concrete waterways clearly designed to avoid flash flooding. The sun shone on our faces and we felt warm, behind us dark, brooding clouds grew.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-005-carlton-park-funchal.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-005-carlton-park-funchal.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-007-funchal-roundabout.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-007-funchal-roundabout.jpg)

Quite by accident we found ourselves in Funchal’s Mercado dos Lavradores, a market selling the island’s local produce. Here fishermen showcased their latest catch; in the fish hall men hacked at tuna with machetes, their huge heads discarded on the floor; Skabbard lay out for all to see, decapitated on request.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-008-mercado-dos-lavradores-funchal.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-008-mercado-dos-lavradores-funchal.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-012-grumpy-fish-head-man.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-012-grumpy-fish-head-man.jpg)

From the interesting yet macabre market the road took us down to the beach, if you can call it that. A volcanic black sandy bay with seagulls and protected by a sea wall. We perched for a picnic lunch as the storm descended. Quickly eating up our chorizo and fresh bread, washed down with some Um Bongo, before the heavens opened; we ran for cover to the cable car ticket office. They buttoned down the hatches and closed the cars whilst the brief storm passed. Down here it was only heavy rain, up in Monte, the other end of the cable cars, it had turned to hail. “It’s worst when it comes from the sea and the mountains”.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-013-um-bongo.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-013-um-bongo.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-016-storm-coming.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-016-storm-coming.jpg)

Then it was a different place, as quickly as it had arrived the storm disappeared, revealing clear blue skies and a hot sunshine. Wet weather gear, available at an instant, is a must have. All the puddles dried up and by a fountain we gobbled up some Madeira honey cake.

When the cable cars reopened we took the 20 minute trip up to Monte, a €15 roundtrip. Sam’s fear of heights materialised when we sat down, first from the delayed closing of the car doors, then the swaying and the sudden rocking as the car passed large green masts. Whilst Sam grabbed on for dear life, I hopped around shooting all sorts of photos as we climbed up the mountain, much to Sam’s annoyance I asked her to pose,  “pull a worried look,” I said.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-017-panicked.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-017-panicked.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-018-funchal-cable-car.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-018-funchal-cable-car.jpg)

At the top we toured the [grounds of a remote hotel](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2796858-10780389?url=http://www.hotels.com/ho213337/charming-hotels-quinta-do-monte-funchal-portugal/ "Quinta do Monte") then the Church of Nossa Senhora; with doors that beautifully looked down onto Funchal and the sea below. A wedding stopped us going in. On the road beneath the church were men in white with straw hats, and after a tipple of alcohol they pushed tourists down hill on huge wooden toboggans; the famous Monte toboggan ride. Descending the road amongst the occasional car, the men used their steel tipped shoes to brake and turn. In the distance a bus brought the men back up, and a truck carried the seats to the starting point. The cable car doesn’t stay open in the evening, and we rushed back to make one of the last cars back down. As the car approached the edge, Sam’s fears doubled, and she gripped my hand all the way down.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-029-nossa-senhora-church.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-029-nossa-senhora-church.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-028-monte-toboggan-ride.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-028-monte-toboggan-ride.jpg)

In the old town for the evening we dodged the touts and the capitalised menus they held, even if they were charming and knew the word “fiddlesticks”. We deliberated a lot, and no place really stood out amongst the plethora of tourist eateries. Eventually, our bellies pressuring us, we sat down at Arsenio’s, outside on Rua de Santa Maria. Our waiter was grumpy and said little and our food choices were conservative.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Barbecued Swordfish kebab
*   Barbecued Steak filet kebab
*   With chips and salad
*   Passion fruit pudding (more like a jelly)
*   A very strong Irish coffee
</div>

The barbecued mains were cooked to perfection and with their seasoning tasted fabulous. Relaxed and with a view of the street we watched tourists peruse menus against the golden glow of the setting sun. Cars traversed impossibly tight corners under the watching eye of a policeman, and young-uns grew rowdy at the bar opposite. Soon the restaurant was full, and locals stopped by to talk to their friends outside. An old man shouted, “Live music, fado singing”, which we, for a long time, misheard as “father singing”; with each shout we strained to hear clearly. At 8pm the traditional music started, and then we left, catching the orange number 2 bus back to Vila Vicencia.

On Sunday we planned our first Levada walk. Levadas are man made concrete waterways that irrigate the island, delivering water from the rain soaked north to the sometimes rainless south. The whole network is an engineering marvel, with slopes set at a slight incline to keep water flowing at a steady pace. They reach up into the highest peaks of the mountain and can be followed, on foot, sometimes dangerously, for spectacular walks with amazing views and an occasional adrenaline rush.

Sam had her walking boots on at breakfast, which caught the interest of John and Jenni, two intrepid holidaymakers looking to do some serious walking. Soon we had our maps spread out across the breakfast table comparing routes and plans. Using our [Sunflower Landscapes’s Madeira walks and tours guide](http://amzn.to/mcTwRT "Read reviews on Amazon"), we found a walk, number 1 by chance, that started by our hotel. Sunday buses weren’t an issue, and the rock crushing plant down in the Soccoridos valley was closed. Excellent, we’ll grab some food and start at 11:30am.

It had been raining most of the morning and the ground was wet and the air cool, just right.  Red painted signs on kerbs and walls pointed us to Levada dos Piornais which we followed upwards and westwards, around to Amparo and Lombada then northwards passed a winged bridge and up through the breathtaking Ribeira dos Soccoridos.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-032-winged-bridge.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-032-winged-bridge.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-034-soccoridos-valley.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-034-soccoridos-valley.jpg)

The concrete walkway, a foot and a half across and left of a running water channel, was often cracked or broken. “HOLE,” John shouted, as we walked in single file, dodging the nasty gaps and their treacherous watery ends. Through banana plantations and terraced sugar canes we trekked, going higher and higher.

The higher we got the the more beautiful the views grew and the more vertiginous the walk  became. Soon the levada was carved into solid rock, beneath us and to our side a sheer drop to the valley floor. Railings protected us, but they wobbled and had occasionally fallen down. Sam didn’t bat an eyelid, and sailed through without a sign of any vertigo (to my relief!). There was an occasional tunnel and we stooped low with bags off to pass through. Jenni’s purple coat fell into the Levada, and there was a hairy moment as Sam slipped trying to grab it.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-035-levada-walk.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-035-levada-walk.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-036-levada-walk.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-036-levada-walk.jpg)

We left the Piornais Levada at Santa Quiteria, a hill we mistakenly climbed, where a rusted burnt-out car perilously held onto the cliff side. Before continuing to Levada do Curral we stopped at a local pub for “a cheeky one” and shortly after, at 3pm, we had our picnic lunch. The usual Sam and Paul picnic came with fresh bread, salami slices, crisps and Maracuja juice (passion fruit), as I dangled my feet over a racing water channel. The weather had cleared up, the sun now hot on our necks.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-037-rusted-car.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-037-rusted-car.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-038-picnic.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-038-picnic.jpg)

Along the Levada do Curral we continued for another hour, climbing ever higher, the guide warning of a point where the walk grew “very dangerous”. The houses ended, and we passed a pool of singing frogs. Onwards and upwards, the railings became less frequent, the concrete more cracked and the drops higher and more severe, but we were rewarded with beautiful valley views.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-039-levada-walk.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-039-levada-walk.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-041-soccoridos-valley.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-041-soccoridos-valley.jpg)

We pressed further until Sam’s vertigo got the better of her and we had to pause. Three of us continued a little more, looking for an isolated house that signified danger, but sheer drops without railings and a very thin path made us stop and turn back.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-043-dangerous-levada-do-curral.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-043-dangerous-levada-do-curral.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-155-levada-do-curral.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-155-levada-do-curral.jpg)

We returned the way we came, turning off the Levada where we joined it, narrowly missing a pub where John could “smell the beer”, then towards Madeira shopping and the bus home. Back in the hotel zone we shared coffee and cake and soon it was time for an evening meal.

From a bus to the old town we walked up Rua Santa Maria to Riso, a refreshingly upmarket restaurant that specialised in risotto. The building itself was nested into the sea wall, and offered gorgeous sea views, as if on a boat without all the rocking. With a dry Madeira wine and some Coral beer we sat above everyone and ordered:

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Pate, olives and puffed rice
*   Sweet potato caldo verde (soup)
*   Duck risotto, portugese style
*   Asparagus and scallop risotto
</div>

From above Sam watched everyone’s meals come out, she protested as a complete stranger caked her dish in salt, talked about another man in red who looked flustered and pointed out a group interrupting a couple’s romantic meal for a photo. We were clearly in a prime people watching spot.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-045-madeira-wine-at-riso.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-045-madeira-wine-at-riso.jpg)

Our soup was hugely disappointing and incredibly salty, but the risottos were excellent. The sun set and the sea disappeared, the Porto Santo ferry (a ferry, not a cruise liner) came home and we departed, down the cobbled street that hurt Sam’s feet, beneath the flowery lights.

Monday was our designated chill day, the intention was a trip to the lido, a swim in the pool and a bit of sun bathing. With my Apple draw-string swim bag and red flip-flops we wandered down to find the lido shut, until at least July. Hrmph. After an hour or so of wandering the bland hotel zone coast, passing the naval club and another uninspiring lido we gave up and chilled by our hotel pool. In the hot sun I read Ernest Hemingway’s “A moveable feast”, feet dipped in the deep cold pool, cold Maracuja juice in hand and with a cheese and ham toastie for lunch.

We realised we needed to get out of Funchal to see the best parts of Madeira, and a coach tour didn’t take our fancy. Around the corner were Hertz, Avis and all the car rental companies. We popped into Hertz and booked a Ford Fiesta for two days, starting Wednesday. We got a good deal and both of us were allowed to drive. Having never driven on the right and knowing all the hill starts I’d be doing I was nervous to say the least. Mission accomplished though.

Now a trip into Funchal to make the most of it, to do something interesting and enjoy a nice meal. After a whip around the Se (cathedral) we found Blandy’s Madeira wine tasting and tour. For a mere €5 each, with two tastings included, we spent 45 minutes learning about Sercial, Verdelho, Bual and Malmsey grapes, how the wines are fortified and what makes a vintage. The 3yr old ‘branded’ wine tasted bland, but the 10yr Bual was scrumptious. The couple we shared the tour with (a manager from Oxfordshire with experience as a banana and tomato farmer in Egypt) agreed. Two glasses each wasn’t enough and we ordered a flight of four 10 year old wines, one of each grape variety, for a proper taste. Our favourites were the Sercial and Bual, and at the airport we made sure to buy a bottle of each. We picked up a couple of aperitif glasses too.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-053-blandys-tasting.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-053-blandys-tasting.jpg)

Our dinner choice this evening was atrocious, and we ignored our golden rule of telling restaurant touts to piss off. Maybe it’s because one of our guide books recommended the place, but we really should have left before ordering. The culprit was O’Tapassol, a so called “favourite of old Madeira hands”, its inside menu was different to the one outside and in the small space rickety garden tables were crammed in for maximum profit, no elbow room to spare. The business cards and serviettes highlighted that this restaurant and the one next door, Le Jardin, were the same establishment, it all felt dodgy.

Food choices were conservative, a Madeira style Skabbard in a white sauce and sardines, with some limpets to start. Having drunk so much Madeira wine we ordered only water. From then on the waiters pecked at us, we had literally six different people attending to us. Our water was refilled every 20 seconds, sometimes without sipping. The food was poor, and the sardines weren’t gutted properly. Peck, peck, peck. The plate Sam used to put her bones on kept being taken away and brought back clean, every couple of minutes. Peck, peck. I had had enough, and after shouting at a waiter and telling the tout his place was shit we promptly left.

Maybe it was the alcohol I’d had earlier, but I don’t ever get angry, I’m mild mannered and polite even when I’m fuming on the inside. Today was different and the anger excited me, it was the only positive experience.

<!--nextpage-->

At breakfast again we planned another day’s walk with John and Jenni. After fried egg on toast and cake (Sam somehow managing to get ketchup over her cake!), we again bought picnic food before just making the 113 green and white bus from town to Ponta De São Lourenço, via a water park, the airport, Machico and Caniçal. After an hour of curly bends and ups and downs we reached the end of civilisation, a roundabout that doubled back on itself.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-054-machico.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-054-machico.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-055-sam-buses.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-055-sam-buses.jpg)

This wasn’t a levada walk, it was a steep coastal one in glorious sunshine and without any shade. It’s number 13 in the [sunflower guide](http://amzn.to/mcTwRT "Read reviews on Amazon"). The landscape is barren and alien to the rest of Madeira. Sharp escarpments point out of the sea and the land is covered with nettles and flowers. With the Desertas islands in the distance, and Madeira under cloud cover behind us, we set out in the sun along the Abra Bay.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-059-ponto-de-sao-lourenco.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-059-ponto-de-sao-lourenco.jpg)

In single file again, John and Jenni leading the way, we climbed down the first big slope and around to a vantage point that looked north, and some so called sea horse rock formations. Then up again, a thin dirt track carved into the side of these towering rocks. Zig zagging, bumpy and steep it was easy to trip. Half way to the tip of the island a narrow rocky saddle connected us to the next part, here the cliffs fall away either side, but Sam’s vertigo didn’t make an appearance.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-060-ponto-de-sao-lourenco.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-060-ponto-de-sao-lourenco.jpg)

We stopped for lunch at the shaded Casa do Sardinha (park ranger’s house). Yummy fresh croissants, meat slices, brie, stodgy bread, biscuits and fresh papaya. It was so good the lizards wanted it, one crazy fella diving across our table and almost into the food bag as John tried to slice his unripe tomato with a pen knife. So many lizards here, sometimes it felt like the walls were moving. No bins or loos though, time to carry on.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-064-papaya-picnic.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-064-papaya-picnic.jpg)

We left the hardest point until after lunch. A hard climb to the peak of Ponta do Furado. At the top, out of breath and sweaty, we had awesome 360 degree sea views and Madeira looked magnificent. Beneath us the sea raged, lashing the rocks.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-066-climbing-ponta-do-furado.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-066-climbing-ponta-do-furado.jpg)

Back down again, a quick zig zag route, hard on the knees, we headed back to the roundabout. Mid afternoon now, the sun bearing down, the last hill felt endless, but rounding the corner we spotted an ice cream van! Five hours since we started and the walk was over and we had chilled (and cheap) victory beer to celebrate!

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-081-coral-beer.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-081-coral-beer.jpg)

In the evening we stopped by a restaurant we’d eyed up before, Restaurant Tokos. We made a reservation for nine o’clock and went to the Pestana Village Hotel’s Bar Da Fonte for a couple of Madeira (wine) based cocktails.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-141-restaurant-tokos.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-141-restaurant-tokos.jpg)

At Tokos we were seated in a very small, eccentrically decorated restaurant-room with full kitchen at the side. It was a small affair with only a waiter, a waitress, a sous chef and the enigmatic Phillipe, the head chef. Watercolours of Phillipe hung to my left (sitting in wrong sized frames) and juxtaposed a trumpet collection above the kitchen and a mini wine-rack and ladder above the entrance to the loos. This place felt very special and it oozed character, from the neon blue lights out front to the personal PC in the corner and the classical playlist.

As we ordered Phillipe gleefully talked to diners, sang and entertained as he concocted exquisite sauces with perfection. By some quirk of the menu, for all three courses Sam and I wanted the same dish, I compromised only on dessert.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Squid Tokos: Battered Macronesia baby squid with chicory, tomato, baby onions and black olives, served with homemade tartare.
*   Prawns a Diablo: Shelled wild prawns sauteed in garlic , oregano and olive oil, flambeed in brandy. In a sauce comprised of chilli, tomato pulp, garlic, oregano, olive oil and a reduction of white wine and prawn heads. Served with sauteed potatoes/garlic rice.*   Flambeed Banana (not Flambeed Ananas — pineapple, a subtle distinction in the pronunciation it seems)
*   Apple Pie
</div>

The food was magnificent. Every mouthful perfect. Portion sizes exact. Nothing short of fabulous. There aren’t enough yummy nom-nom adjectives to explain how tasty the squid, prawns, sauces and desserts were!

The finnish couple next to us had been coming here for 20 years, and with every trip would come to Tokos at least three times, “We’ll be back on Thursday”, “You could come back tomorrow too,” Phillipe joked, “I have seven children to feed!” (he doesn’t). It seems Phillipe is a local celebrity, another couple had visited many years ago and asked why he wasn’t playing the trumpet. If we ever came back, we’d eat here as much as we could afford.

We were the last couple left in the restaurant and we watched as the chef prepared our desserts. Great flames appeared from behind the counter and the waitress calmly told us, “Chef is burning your banana, sorry”. Of course it was perfect and yummy, even if banana is not ananas and a flambeed pineapple might have been preferable.

This was undoubtedly one of the greatest dining experiences we’ve ever had.

Wednesday started nervously as we embarked on our great ‘wrong side of the road’ car rental adventure. After a light brekkie and a slow queue at the Hertz office we picked up the blue Ford Fiesta and headed for the hills. At a quiet road I practiced gear changes and manoeuvring in an attempt to avoid bashing the door with my elbow every time I changed gear. Throwing in a bit of hill start practice too, it might as well have been a driving lesson for half an hour.

Soon enough I was confident I could control the car and we began our car tour, number 5 in the [sunflower book](http://amzn.to/mcTwRT "Read reviews on Amazon"). We headed north, through the Encumeadá tunnel to São Vicente on the north coast. In the north trees clung to steep rock faces and natural waterfalls flowed from impenetrable clouds, and without the direct sun it all felt that much darker.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-083-waterfalls.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-083-waterfalls.jpg)

Along the coast we made an occasional stop, at Seixal and a seaside promenade at Praia. We avoided the suggested scenic coastal roads, they’d been chained off and on inspection large sections had fallen into the sea.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-084-samantha.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-084-samantha.jpg)

At Ribeira da Janela we made two sharp right turns for a detour inland, towards Fanal. A short way up the very steep and hairpin lined hill we weren’t sure whether the road looked safe or if it was even the right one. On a steep incline, where a turn in the road was egregious and reversing downright dangerous, we had no choice but to continue. Putting the Fiesta into second I revved up and around each hairpin, stopping once, suddenly, as a coach swept across the tarmac as it turned. Third gear had been so abused that even on the flat the car struggled to hold any speed, but we chugged along at a decent pace.

Near the top the road levelled out and soon we’d climbed from sea level to a view point above the clouds. Standing on picnic benches I watched huge clouds form beneath me, slowly growing, slowly climbing. Everything else silent, the sun bearing down. It was awe inspiring.

At Posto Florestal we stopped for food and were joined by birds keen to thief our croissants and bread. With a little bait I was able to snap a few pictures of them.
The ground was damp and the air moist, and from clear skies we fell into thick fog and back again, within a minute. Eventually the fog descended and didn’t shift, and all hopes of a view from the nearby mound were lost. We stood eerily in thick fog not daring to move too far – a sheer drop potentially in front of us. With the odd sound of hooves cows passed us and we waited for some visibility before returning to the car.

Back down the 209’s curling, twisting course we returned. Porto Moniz’s lava-rock pools didn’t interest us enough to stop, and at Santa we made a 12km detour to Achadas da Cruz. Up here there’s a spectacular straight-down view of Quebrada Nova, which can be reached by a perilous cable car ride. As the cable cars disappeared over the edge the cable chassis wobbled. No way were we doing this ride, and instead we relaxed with coffee and cake at the cafe next door.

On the home stretch now, we took the 110 back along the mountain peaks. The guide talked of magnificent views, but we were deep in fog and rain, trying to work out how to turn on the fog lights. At the “much loved beauty spot” of Rabaçal we saw only pebbles and a signpost. We couldn’t drive faster than 20km per hour it was so dark. The clouds momentarily lifted as we drove across the obscure moors of the Paul da Serra with its eerie wind turbines.

Then we began our descent to Encumeadá to the tunes of Portuguese radio; Phoenix played, we notched up the volume and enjoyed the drive, eventually low enough to catch more spectacular valley views.

Not wanting to eat in Funchal while we had the car we made a byline along the west coast in search of a good restaurant. Our awful AA guide recommended somewhere that appeared quite terrible, and we concluded he didn’t have a clue what he was talking about. Ribeira Brava is a coach stop off point, and is perfectly avoidable, literally nothing to see here. Carrying on, still hopeful, we reached [Ponta do Sol](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2796858-10780389?url=http://www.hotels.com/de1058278/hotels-ponta-do-sol-portugal/ "Hotels in Ponta do Sol"). It’s a quaint pretty village, nestling in a small cove with a little beach, a new hotel and a few eateries. It was a little retreat from the tourist bustle of Funchal, perfect.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-122-hotel-da-vila.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-122-hotel-da-vila.jpg)

We ate at the cool looking Hotel da Vila, with its outdoor leather sofas, smart furniture and modern style. With the charming waiter’s advice we ordered:

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Octopus salad stuffed with garlic, a starter to share
*   Fish of the day, Parrot fish with potatoes and vegetables
*   Salmon (Hotel da Vila style) with bacon and potatoes
*   Raspberry compote
*   Chocolate and ice cream crepe
</div>

I hadn’t tried octopus since Greece, when we’d had it grilled and tough. This was totally different and delicious. The fish was excellent too.

Pleasantly filled we skipped along the rocks outside to watch the sunset. From blue to orange, red and then nighttime, we drove home, through the tunnels, back across the winged bridge to Funchal.

On our second day with the car it was Sam’s turn to drive, and the first hour or so was again nerve-racking. Today’s plan was [car tour 4](http://amzn.to/mcTwRT "Read reviews on Amazon"), “Mountains and more mountains”. Afraid of more fog we left early, driving through the centre and then north, up the twirling roads to Monte and beyond, to Poiso and then high into the mountains, 1.8km up to the Arieiro peak.

(A word of warning, the parking here is nightmarish if its busy, keep to the right and park by the roundabout to avoid the steep incline and coaches.)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-124-arieiro-peak.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-124-arieiro-peak.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-125-arieiro-views.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-125-arieiro-views.jpg)

Arieiro is breathtaking, and we’d made it early enough to avoid fog. Rock escarpments stab the air through swirling infant clouds, and the valley floor sits misty in the distance. Thin rocky walks run along rough terrain, hugging the walls and narrow ledges, into the mist. We started out, climbing downwards to see the magnificent views, but stopped at the first roadblock, a wooden barrier warning, “Danger do not cross”, a small hole punched through, and large enough to continue. Being so high, standing above the clouds and still with a sea view, the natural beauty is just incredible.

The clouds were starting to move in now, and soon our already dangerous path would be in fog. With a melted Mars bar energy boost, we turned back. Sam’s vertigo played up and I drove the downhill return leg, all the way to Santo da Serra and Portela.

Now the clouds were thick, the weather cold and all views cut short. Skipping parts of the tour we took the tunnels around the north east to Santana. Despite its A shaped houses there’s nothing to see here, just lots of coaches and cafes rammed with coach patrons. In said rammed cafe we re-energised with pizza and coffee.

A little nauseous and cold, we didn’t fancy three more hours of driving. We called an end to car tour 4 and headed home via the highway, with a single stop-off at Porto da Cruz where the air was permeated by the smell of brewing beer. Driving south, the sun came out and it felt like a different place. A tour of the island is all four seasons.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-140-porto-da-cruz.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-140-porto-da-cruz.jpg)

Back by 3pm, we returned the car and chilled poolside with our books, once again in the hot hot sun. The pool just warm enough to dip into. We caught up with John and Jenni. They’d taken the expensive Thomson “Western Wonders” coach tour, which had been a huge disappointment and not fitting to the description. Although John had learnt all about the many many types of banana the island grew, from the dwarf bananas to those for diabetics. He was positively thrilled.

For our last evening, “At the Piano” looked perfect, even if it did feel a little like a wedding reception, perfectly white and decorated with petals. A family tragedy meant the head chef had to abandon the kitchen, and a couple of our menu choices weren’t available. The set menu looked very tempting, especially with a wine flight, but we went a la carte:

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Limpets and cauliflower soup with quails egg
*   Sweet potato balls and prawns
*   Prawns in a hot chilli sauce with sauteed potatoes
*   Salmon with boiled potatoes and vegetables
</div>

Although delicious, my meal resembled a cheaper version of the prawns I’d had at Tokos, and the difference was clear, but Sam loved her salmon. The 2008 Montedas Servas (alentejano) was the nicest Rose wine I’ve ever tasted. To round off our evening and holiday, perfectly happy to be intoxicated, we ordered liqueurs; homemade passionfruit liqueur, a Tia Maria coffee and, because the card machine was being so very slow, a lovely complimentary blackberry liqueur.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-143-at-the-piano.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-143-at-the-piano.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-145-at-the-piano.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-145-at-the-piano.jpg)

We walked around the block one more time before heading home, bumping into chef Philipe outside Tokos, he’d had a hard night, “making soup for 1000” he said. In the warm night air we stumbled, past the irish pub with its green cadillac, past Chalet Vicente, past the “magical” glass box with football highlights, past the roads to the sea, across the crossing, past Joe’s wine shop and home through the great green gates.

<!--nextpage-->

Thunderstorms beckoned us at 9am the next morning. Looks like our plan of packing and chilling by the pool was shot. Post-breakfast, post-packing and post-checkout, downstairs we sat with John and Jenni where they played knockout whist and rummy, the rain hammering down on the porch outside. This is the point where Sam realises she’s lost her shoes and runs around to the car rental place to find them, meanwhile the sun reappears, the skies clear and we’ve gone from winter to summer.

We shared lunch with John and Jenni at Chalet Vicente, once again portions were huge, my barbecued steak skewer large enough to put in a doggy bag and keep for the plane. All very tasty, as to be expected. With a couple of hours to go, we relaxed by the pool, making the most of the sun before our coach transfer home.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/madeira-146-home-time.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/madeira-146-home-time.jpg)

Then it was time to go, we said our goodbyes and we were whisked away. On the plane we had the tastiest in-flight meal you could dream of; steak and sausage sandwiches in fresh bread, our duty free Madeira wine sat beneath us. Big Momma’s House 3 played on the screens and I snapped away with the DSLR.

Soon it was all over, the holiday ended, the Madeira experience complete. I doubt we’ll ever go back, we’ve so many more places to explore.
