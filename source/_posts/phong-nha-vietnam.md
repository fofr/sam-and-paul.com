We arrived into Dong Hoi about 4pm, the evening was encroaching and our taxi driver picked us up. We were heading for Ben and Bich's Phong Nha Farmstay, a relatively new hostel-like accommodation that had rave reviews on Trip Advisor and Lonely Planet. We were headed to the area to see Paradise Cave, an enormous newly opened cave that looked simply incredible.

It took about an hour to get from Dong Hoi to the farmstay, through quiet rural roads, past rice paddies that were being harvested, and water buffalo grazing. We turned left down a narrow road, alongside towers of drying rice plants and a local community playing volleyball, stopping briefly to pick up Ben's son, then onwards to our accommodation.

With our great big red and blue backpacks, we stumbled out of the van. Pawel greeted us, “Why did you bring so much beer? We have beer!”. Inside music played from an iPod hooked up to some loudspeakers, two guys were rearranging a set of whiteboards where tomorrow's tours were being posted and the place was full of people. Lounging on sofas, playing pool, drinking beer, playing volleyball in the small pool at the rear. It oozed a welcoming, party vibe.

Our room was modest. A bed with mosquito nets, a small bathroom, some shelves and air conditioning, everything you really need, plus a couple of bugs here and there.

The view from the bedroom however was breathtaking. Bright green rice paddies stretched out into the distance until they met towering limestone mountains which climbed gloriously into the sky, the sun setting just behind, amidst the orange hue of a few clouds. We stood for a few minutes just to take it all in.

Downstairs again we said our hellos, and got to know a couple of people, Andy and Beth were on their honeymoon, they'd been to Hoi An and we shared stories and plans, as you do.

We had beer, some very good beef Pho and umm'd and ahh'd about which tour we should do. Tomorrow there was a crazy Paradise Cave trek taking place — 14km through pitch black caves, pretty expensive at $125 each; it was that or a bike ride to Phong Nha caves. We questioned a lot of people and eventually committed to doing the trek, signing up our names on the board in red marker pen. We signed up for the National Park tour the day after, a tour that runs every other day.

Dave, a loud, brash, and self-proclaimed fat Australian, wearing his red hawaiian shirt, explained the cave tour. “Underground rivers, kayaking, swimming, climbing over big fuckin' rocks, there were parts where if the guide hadn't been there I'd have died. This [the Phong Nha tour] is good, but this [pointing at the cave trek], this is better than Macchu Piccu. This is incredible”. Yes, a real adventure, but this unsettled us, what had we signed up for?

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![The tour boards at Phong Nha farmstay](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-453.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-453.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">The tour boards at Phong Nha farmstay</figcaption></figure>

We retired, but not before standing on the balcony and watching the stunning thunderstorm taking place over the mountains. A flash of fork lightning, spreading out across the sky, lighting up the rice paddies, and then the crack of thunder.

That night I imagined what the tour would be like. Would we be stranded in some pitch black cavern, squeezing through the tiniest of spaces and climbing down small holes? What if we got lost? What if I was forced to swim — I don't really do swimming. But I swiftly fell asleep beneath the mosquito nets, the red light of the anti-mozzy spray glowing dimly.

Breakfast at 7am for an 8am departure Bich had told us. At 6:30am the iPhone alarm beckoned and we wearily packed our bags.

On the porch outside the farmstay, again with glorious views of rice paddies and mountains, we ate our breakfast, Beef Pho for me, noodles for brekkie. We ate with the others going on the trek, Liz, Warwick and co., others seemed nervous like us, which calmed me. Enigma blasted from the farmstay speakers, yes, this was going to be epic.

At 8ish we left, (“ish”, not a German 8am apparently), seven of us in a minivan ready to embark on a 14km trek through one of the world's largest caves, a cave 60km in total. Epic music filled the van, windows open, wind rushing in, and we raced from the village through Phong Nha town, onwards to the national park and Paradise Cave.

The cave was about 40km away, through a national park gate where entrance is restricted. At the newly opened tourist attraction we met our guide, a smiley young Vietnamese guy called Dong, he spoke only a little broken English.

To reach the cave entrance you board a yellow electronic vehicle, it's very Jurassic Park, so, of course, we hummed the theme tune. After the ride you're fronted with 500 steps surrounded in luscious rainforest foliage. The heavens opened and we climbed them in the rain, to the guide's hut where we'd be kitted out.

The kit consisted of a headlamp, and rugged jacket and trousers. Shoes were also available, though of course we had our own walking boots. Most of the available Vietnamese shoe sizes were too small for everyone.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Paradise cave expedition group](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-381.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-381.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Paradise cave expedition group</figcaption></figure>

Kitted out, headlamps tested, dressed and ready to go, we set off. The diminutive entrance to the cave is an opening at the foot of ten or so steps. This is the entrance everyone takes, and leads to the first 1km which has boardwalks and lights for visitors.

We ambled down the slippery steps and turned the corner. Wow, we were standing in an enormous underground cavern that expanded beneath us. Larger than a concert hall, but with equally good acoustics. There was a slight haze from the moisture in the air, and we descended another 100 or so steps to its base.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Paradise Cave expanding beneath us](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-419.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-419.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Paradise Cave expanding beneath us</figcaption></figure>

Paradise cave is simply magnificent, more enormous and wonderful than any cave I have ever seen. The stalagmites are great deformed columns that reach to the ceiling, the stalactites, equally big, hang down, deadly looking spikes hovering above. The lighting is serene, and subtly highlights the natural colours of the million year old limestone formations. From eerie and gothic bulging statues to towering frozen waterfalls, we strolled through the first kilometre, passing tour groups, proudly dressed in caving gear.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Hiking 14km of this, only in the dark, with headlamps](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-434.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-434.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Hiking 14km of this, only in the dark, with headlamps</figcaption></figure>

The boardwalk ends with a circular viewing platform and that's where most tourists stop. Our guide reaches over the fence, opens a small hidden gate and we climb down a ladder to the cave floor. Now the adventure begins, and we climbed our first of many slippery stone slopes, Matt not quite getting his footing right and falling (or rolling) quite impressively. We waved goodbye to the lights, clicked on our headlamps and turned into the darkness.

In such cold black our headlamps were surprisingly powerful. We lit up the large cavern and looked around, standing somewhere less than 100 people have ever been, wary not to stand on something precious. My fears of small cramped places were blown away, these were huge towering caverns, as enormous as a few storey buildings, but seen only by a privileged few.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Entering the darkness](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-386.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-386.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Entering the darkness</figcaption></figure>

A few caverns in, we gathered together and one by one turned off our headlamps. The cavern rapidly shrank, and with all the lights off the space felt tiny. Pitch black, I waved my hand in front of my face, until I hit my nose. Nope, I can see absolutely nothing. My eyes played tricks on me, trying to make sense of the darkness and filling in gaps with what I'd seen before. It was silent too, no wind, no birds or animals or motors or water rushing by, silence, but for the breathing of other people. We stood for minutes, but it felt like hours, not wanting to be the first to turn their light back on, but not moving either.

Click, the light returned and we continued, each talking about how we'd felt in the darkness. We realised how dependent we were on the batteries in our lamps. Especially as our guide's torch died and we watched him replace the batteries with his spares, only a couple of kilometres in.

We climbed limestone mounds, tiptoed across frozen limestone lakes, and marvelled at huge limestone organs, with hollow musical tubes. All around us small sapling stalagmites grew from the floor. Occasionally a giant formation lay on the ground, having grown too large and come crashing down, many thousands of years ago. Amongst the limestone were layers of thick brown clay, perfectly smooth and untouched for years.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Glittering cave wall](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-388.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-388.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Glittering cave wall</figcaption></figure>

The caves were cool, but without any wind, no breeze at all, and hiking was hot and sweaty (and somewhat smelly).

4km in we stopped for a rest, against many towering layers of limestone, like a natural amphitheatre, or a solid stone waterfall. We climbed to the top, where a sparkling diamond like formation stunned us, like glistening water overflowing from the peak. I set up the tripod and tried out some long exposure shots.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Inside the stone amphitheatre](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-392.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-392.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Inside the stone amphitheatre</figcaption></figure>

Dong stopped amidst a large cavern and pointed to the ceiling, “highest point” he said. A drip was falling from the roof, creating a small stalagmite beneath us, we watched the water fall, glistening in the light of our headlamps, falling for an eternity. Drip… … drip… … drip.

Something small was moving on the ground ahead of us. A bug, a colourless spiny sub-species of grasshopper with enormous antennae. It lives its entire life in pitch black. How did it get here? How does it survive down here? We marvelled at this peculiar creature, and watched as it scurried away.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Colourless creatures living in the depths of Paradise Cave](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-391.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-391.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Colourless creatures living in the depths of Paradise Cave</figcaption></figure>

At 6km we came to an underground river and a kayak, a rather unstable kayak prone to the occasional capsize. Two at a time we climbed in, and one of our Vietnamese guides rowed us through the cave to the other side.

When the first group left, those of us still at the clay walled stony port turned off our headlamps. We watched as the light from the boat slowly drifted away, moving into the distance the light grew dim, occasionally flashing between some rocks, until it was gone, and we were in darkness. Just the sound of the water and the boat knocking into rocks. We stayed in the darkness until the boat returned, light slowly returning to us, our carriage arriving from the depths of nowhere.

We were the penultimate two to go by kayak, and it was a shaky ordeal. The water was shallow, and the formations made using oars difficult. We ducked as a low ceiling narrowly passed us. I put on the fluorescent orange lifejacket, and hoped we'd make it across without a problem. And we did, arriving at a similar clay port where those waiting were sculpting many small clay figures on the river bank. Half way through a red and white coloured moth landed on my hand, “what are you doing here?” I asked, perplexed that my new friend could be in here.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Underground kayaking in Paradise Cave](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-410.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-410.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Underground kayaking in Paradise Cave</figcaption></figure>

As we continued through a few more caverns, passing the “lowest point” in the cave, a low ceiling we ducked and clambered through (nothing too strenuous). We were nearing the end of the route, the midpoint of the hike and our spot to have some lunch.

A narrow entryway to a cavern was met with a delightful cool breeze, and from the hallway we could see the slightest light coming in. As we edged closer the light grew stronger, and the sound of a river eked into the cave.

And then we saw the light source and the area it shone down upon, and what a site to behold. A giant, luscious sinkhole with sunlight and rainwater pouring in, trees towering above, roots wrapped around the walls, above a raging underground river in a cavern large enough to house a twenty storey building. Between the sinkhole and the river, a layer of definitive white cloud. Phenomenal and beautiful. Despite my trying, it was impossible to capture the enormity and wonder of this place in a photo.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--portrait">[![An enormous sink hole](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-400.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-400.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">An enormous sink hole</figcaption></figure>

There was one last obstacle before lunch, crossing the raging river via a string of rocks to reach a stoney plateau. The guides stood on the sides and helped us cross, pointing out where to stand.

I was last to go, in my heavy duty walking boots I balanced precariously on a wet slippery rock, the river roaring beneath me. Dong pointed to where I should step, I stepped, I missed, I slipped and I plunged into the raging river, up to my waist. The hand of our guide was all that stopped me from falling further and being taken by the river, he pulled me up and I was sopping. Water dripped from my combats and there was a squelch with every step. I was shaken, furious and relieved.

In my wet state I didn't really relax in the 30 minute mid-hike break, where we ate our pork and rice and stared up into the centre of the sinkhole. Once again we watched the water drops fall for an eternity before smashing on a rock.

The return route was the reverse, going back the same way. Back over the river, leaving the sinkhole, through wondrous tall caverns, through the lowest point, on the kayak, to the tallest point, and 6km, to the publicly accessible lit part of the cave. We marvelled as we discovered more stunning formations, crystal towers buried beneath mountains of rock, tucked away from prying eyes. At the final beautiful formation we stood for a group photo, everyone standing very still as I timed a long exposure shot.

We returned to the light of the lit caverns, emerging from the darkness, muddy and sweaty. Tourists on the boardwalk looked astonished, we proudly smiled and walked on by. Our incredible trek complete, one of the most amazing things we've ever done or ever will do.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Muddy boots](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-420.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-420.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Muddy boots</figcaption></figure>

On the way home we stopped for a quick swim, in the gorgeous turquoise waters of an emergent underground river, amongst a kaleidoscope of butterflies. Yeah, it was that picturesque.

Back in the minibus, discussing which Sigur Ros album was best, through the remainder of the limestone hills, over the river and back to the farmstay; where the music was already playing and the party had started.

Over a cave group dinner everyone planned what to do next; some were going on to Hue, others wanted to do an overnight trek through the jungle. Inside, live music beckoned, a Thai woman covering classics in her own unique style. With our beer we closed out the evening with the rambunctious Dave, and tales of his prior career as a nude life model. Meanwhile Matt was borrowing clothes for a two day trek, in bandana and khaki jacket he morphed into Rambo.

Bugs flitted about and the remnants of a storm passed by, the occasional fork of lightning. We called it a night.

<!--nextpage-->

Up early again, 8am this time, for day two of our Phong Nha farmstay adventure. Today we were taking the Phong Nha Ke-Bang national park tour, a trip Ben gives every other day. We were 17 strong; a motorbike, minibus and 1960s Ford jeep, and after breakfast we left in convoy. Sat in the back of the minibus, the same epic music played out. Bich sat upfront, and another farmstay staffer, Pete, an Aussie in a MAG t-shirt, manned the door, atop a cooler of beer. A couple of honeymooners, a six month long honeymoon no less, Dan and Fiz, sat next to us.

In Phong Nha town we paused for a pickup. While waiting a raucous formed across the road. Looking out the window I was alarmed to see two men running down the street, one chasing the other, brandishing high above his head an eight inch meat cleaver. We all collectively gasped as he threw it and narrowly missed the petrified man, and we held our breath as he continued to swipe at him, never quite making contact. Two brave locals intervened, and everything calmed down. “It cost me $50 to put that on for you”, Ben joked.

Loaded up, if not a little shaken, the convoy continued towards the national park. The limestone mountains grew up around us, thick with jungle foliage. Bich pointed out the sights; a house in town that scavenges for old bomb parts in the forest, they'd carry dangerous explosives for days, to sell on as scrap metal; ponds, scattered throughout the rice paddies, bomb craters from the American war.

The journey was supplemented with tales of Bich's mum, a surviving volunteer that fought for Vietnam during the war. “The Americans would drop mines along this river to prevent the movement of supplies”, we were told, “and after each drop a couple of them would run down the river with a string of floating barrels, the barrels triggered the mines and cleared the river for supplies”.

The park isn't strictly open to tourism, getting in by yourself isn't possible. We were allowed in as we were with locals, locals that knew the park's restrictions on where you can and can't go. A route through the park is still heavily maintained for military purposes, the old Ho Chi Minh trail.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Phong Nha national park](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-425.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-425.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Phong Nha national park</figcaption></figure>

On a hill we marvelled at the beautiful park. Thin layers of low hanging cloud danced amongst the limestone karsts, eerie and magnificent. Ben explained how the rocks were formed, being eroded by fresh water many millennia ago, and listed the known wildlife in the area — bears, apes, and recently tigers, spotted by British cave expedition groups. Spooked by the appearance of another tour group (Oxalis, a group Ben had helped setup), we moved on. Sam and I jumped in the jeep, held on to the metal frame and rumbled around the former gravel roads of the park.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Jeep tour through the national park](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-424.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-424.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Jeep tour through the national park</figcaption></figure>

Next stop, an intersection, with restricted roads that connect north and south, again with wondrous views. Back to the jeep and onwards, Bob Dylan screeching from the stereo, as the convoy's classic motorbike races by. Another war story: “The Americans used to blast the sides of these mountains, causing rocks to block the road”, making it impassable for Vietnamese supplies — “the Vietnamese solution was to throw man power at the problem”; Ben slowed down and pointed out a small cave where volunteers had lived and hid, after each attack they'd come out and clear up the rocks.

Not famously known for being part of the war, this area was still pivotal, one of Vietnam's thinnest points, in some places only 40km across. Recently Bich's mum had met a former pilot that had flown through these mountains, and they'd worked out that on one particular day she'd been shooting at him. The tactics of each side were explained to us; he flew through the valley, drawing gun fire so a B52 bomb route could be plotted. The Vietnamese knew this, and sacrificed gun positions to plot the route, thereby knowing where the bomber would be and how to attack it.

Next stop was the temple of eight ladies, or eight martyrs. Here eight women had lived in a cave which was badly bombed, the entrance became blocked, trapping them inside. For days people tried to get air and supplies to those trapped, but they perished. Now there is a shrine and temple dedicated to them where Vietnamese also pay their respects to the war dead.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![The temple of eight martyrs](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-426.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-426.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">The temple of eight martyrs</figcaption></figure>

In this region Kin ancestor worship is popular, a belief in a spirit world filled with good and bad spirits and with traditions that involve burning paper items to give to their relations in the spirit world. At the temple the inside altar dedication is for the spirits you wish to be associated with, on the outside those you don't — inside first, outside second. In an unlit corner an exhibit showed items girls fighting in the war would've carried; a toothbrush, comb, the famous Ho Chi Minh sandals made from old car tyres.

Outside, Ben continued the tour; in the surrounding areas there remains huge amounts of unexploded ordinance. Many of the bombs dropped were designed for WW2, and for dropping over Germany, they relied on the correct altitude to arm themselves, spinning X number of times. In Vietnam, especially in this area, the altitude varies significantly and the humid climate interfered with the systems — leaving swathes of unarmed, partially armed, undetonated bombs scattered throughout the jungle. The locals refer to some of the devices as “pineapples”, they're yellow and look like fruit, kids find them, play with them and disaster ensues. MAG (Mines Advisory Group) operate to find and disarm these devices but it's a mammoth task that shan't ever be completed.

The ingenuity of the Vietnamese fighting the Americans was on show again. This time, hung up outside the temple, was an old bomb shell being used as a bell. “The Vietnamese would line the mountains with these”, and using a code they could quickly communicate. Unlike American radios they weren't subject to the wet, and if they were bombed you'd just string them back up again.

Paradise Cave was next, the cave we hiked through the day prior. More Jurassic park jeeps, “there's a goat strung up just along there”, Ben noted. Up the steep slope we trekked, again in the rain, and into the cave. Even though it was our second time, it was wondrous, an incredible place. We wandered slowly, taking it all in, and used the tripod to capture shots of us. At the end of the boardwalk we stood for a few moments, in the damp echoey chamber by ourselves. Wasn't yesterday incredible?

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Return to Paradise Cave](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/phong-nha-432.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/phong-nha-432.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Return to Paradise Cave</figcaption></figure>

Lunch break outside the cave gave the mosquitoes the opportunity they needed to bite me, twenty times or so. I must've been the tastiest.

Back in the jeep, “All along the watchtower” playing, “come and take my earth”, we rumbled down to a German built Eco trail. A misty, serene forest split by the most gorgeous turquoise river you'd ever see; like a scene from a movie. In single file we crossed the river on an old bamboo bridge, rotten parts occasionally snapping and falling off.

“Everyone got their swimmies?”, one after another we jumped into the river and swam to the other side. As a guy that doesn't really do swimming, I didn't fancy the strong river current, even with a life jacket. Ben and I took the kayak and beers, handing out cans of 333 to everyone. Beyond the trail lies a sink hole that feeds the river, huge volumes of water are pumped up from nearby caves.

We continue by minivan to where we swum yesterday, only this time we jump into kayaks and head downstream to the entrance of the “Dark Cave”. The way I've written that gives the impression Sam and I are expert kayakers, in actuality we did many 360 degree spins and mostly made it by allowing the current to take us there. Although this time we did manage to avoid a domestic. The guides in the nearby boat laughed at us, and gave us the occasional prod in the right direction.

At the cave entrance we head in by foot, a newly built boardwalk, but it soon ends. And to the surprise of the tour; if you're taking this tour, perhaps you've found this article via Google, you might want to look away now. With the end of the boardwalk, and us all in swimwear, lifejackets and with bonus headlamp, we begin to swim into the cave. A stream of orange fluorescent bodies swimming into the darkness, huge caverns towering above us, the sound of flitting bats echoing throughout the chambers. The light slowly fades, and soon all you see are the bobbing lamps of the swimmers.

As a poor swimmer, I swam with Ben, who also carried Bich on his back. We probably swam about 500m into the cave, ducking under the occasional rocky outcrop and following a narrow channel. At the end was a sandy bay where we gathered and turned off our headlamps. (Have you discerned that we really enjoy standing in pitch black?). “So this is the Dark Cave”, Ben jokes, although he points out its probably named after the razor sharp black basalt rock that lines the cave. He goes on to explain how the tide is a few hours out of sync with outside, and highlights the varieties of sub species found in these caves: funky pale crickets, centipedes and snakes included. “What are you doing Bich?”, she's turned her headlamp on and is playing with the sand, “Looking for snakes,” she replies.

On the way out we angle our headlamps to the roof, Sam swims on her back for the best views. Another enormous magnificent cave that we feel privileged to have seen. In the Kayak again we were much improved, and didn't arrive last. A round of chilled canned beer and back to the farmstay, with one final stop on the bridge for a photo opportunity. Not to mention a family of water buffalo freaking out in the road.

At the farmstay freshly popped pop corn waited for us, with a free cocktail. The sun was setting over the mountains and rice paddies again; you couldn't grow tired of this view. With Dan and Fiz we ate dinner (some of the best Pho we ate in Vietnam) outside, talking about onward plans, Hue, and passing around Sam's Vietnamese hat for photo opps. The Thai singer, she'd been on the tour with us, played again tonight, though the farmstay was quieter. Looking around, one last time, this place is really quite wonderful.

And then it was time to leave, though we didn't want to go; checked out, bags packed, leaky shampoo cleaned up, we said our goodbyes and jumped aboard our ride to the station, via an epic thunderstorm. Slowing to a crawl, we drove through bucketing rain, amongst dazzling skylines, around huge puddles and the occasional suicidal toad to Dong Hoi station.

Six of us were taking the overnight train to Hanoi. A small, sweaty cabin with fake wooden decor, we shoved our bags under the lower bunks and bedded down on the hard mattresses. Our Phong Nha adventure was over, two of the most exciting and epic days I've ever witnessed, and without doubt the highlight of our trip. Magical.
