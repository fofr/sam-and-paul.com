From the [LimeTree hotel in Kuching](/2014/05/kuching-borneo/) we took a leisurely afternoon flight to Kota Kinabalu, and a 40 minute taxi north to the Shangri-La Rasa Ria resort, near Tuaran. Our taxi driver enjoyed cheesy pop music which was broken up by a soporific American-accented radio DJ, the standout track was “hashtag selfie”, with all the depth and nuance of an internet meme. Rasa Ria is so large that it has two receptions, and we arrived at The Garden Wing. “Welcome, this is for you”, beamed the porter, and he struck a gong. Live traditional music begun to play for us, a harmonious reception.

The reception is enormous, and filled with lounging guests in flip-flops. It looks out past the pool at the pristine beach and exudes a sense of calm. Our room was on the fourth floor and had a “rainforest view”, which suited us just fine. I don’t think we’ve ever seen a bed so big. The beach faces west for a perfect beachside sunset. As the sun went down and the sky turned red, guests flocked to the sea with their expensive cameras and tripods (or iPads) to try and capture it.

At Coast, one of the many restaurants on site, it was Lobster night and that won Sam’s vote. The decor is an “under the sea” design, with deep blue lighting and enormous jellyfish lights over the bar. We celebrated an early anniversary dinner with Italian prosecco (then a chardonnay, a sauvignon-blanc and a rosatello), and Sam had the delicious tail of lobster special (which cost about the same as everything else combined).

Breakfast at the Rasa Ria was what we've come to expect from five star resorts, a buffet of epic proportions. Fresh salmon, century eggs, marbled tea-eggs, noodles, rice, fresh tropical fruits, pancakes, waffles, eggs any way you want them, a fry-up (with beef bacon), sushi, noodle soups, pastries, cereal, yoghurts, a cheese board — pretty much everything except pork and bacon. All served from the Coffee Terrace. We discovered a few days later that you can also go to Coast for free a la carte breakfast (plus buffet), which included complimentary prosecco.

One of the main reasons for our visit to this luxurious hotel was the onsite nature reserve and orangutan sanctuary. It meant we didn't have to squeeze in a trip to Sepilok in our two short weeks. The sanctuary takes in orphaned and rescued orangutan youth, and brings them to Sepilok when they are rehabilitated and ready to join others. Before arriving we booked ahead, and paid for a Sunday morning slot to see them.

After breakfast we wandered across the resort to the nature reserve, passing beneath the trees where the hornbill and scarlet macaws spend the day. The birds have had their wings clipped, but they too are rescues. The entrance to the reserve sits next to a Segway circuit, nestled amongst trees and somewhat hidden

A large group of us, perhaps 30, watched a video that demonstrated the work done here, before filing into the reserve and up the dirt path towards the viewing platforms. In the daylight a tame mouse deer watched us, and a pen housed Sambar deer. At the wooden platforms we chose our spot; a good view, a bit of shade, and once again, like in Semenggoh we waited for orangutans.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Mouse deer in the hotel nature reserve](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/kota-kinabalu-006.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/kota-kinabalu-006.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Mouse deer in the hotel nature reserve</figcaption></figure>

After 10 minutes there was a rustling in the trees, you could see the treetops swaying left and right. Two young males swung from the branches, one, then another, from the trees to the ropes and on to the feeding platform, to gather their breakfast. They scoffed their faces with bananas and fruit and dopily climbed to the tree tops. We watched them for half an hour, mesmerised by their lanky arms, grabbing feet and dark piercing eyes. Samantha and I swapped between zoom lens and binocs, alternating between photos and a better view. Eventually they nestled down in the branches high above us, in their newly made nest of leaves, settled down and out of sight.

There are three orangutans here, the third is female, she is new and still very shy. A fourth recently left the park, to continue rehabilitation at Sepilok. After the apes we followed the park's canopy walk, a leisurely and timid affair, a couple of rope bridges slightly above the forest floor, the highlight was a view out across the beach.

The people we met at Shangri-la were much older than us, mostly in their late forties or fifties. A couple from the UK, they'd been here for two weeks told us about a snake they'd spotted at the park entrance. Sure enough, on a branch, perfectly camouflaged (you'd walk right past it unless you knew to look), a Bornean keeled pit viper. Light green on top, pale underneath, it sat perfectly still and was unfazed by the family of long-tailed macaques that began playing nearby. “Is it poisonous?”, “Yes, very”. Some snakes of this species are even nicknamed the “100 pace snake”, if bitten you can walk 100 paces before dropping dead. Lovely, let's not get too close.

As everyone else was leaving, we stuck around to watch the playful macaques, about 7 of them. They hung from their tales and squabbled over fruit, wrestled in the leaves, and groomed each other.

For the rest of the day we relaxed by the (warm) pool, drinking ice cold lime soda. The poolside food was tasty too, just a pizza and burger for us, nothing too fancy. And the sunset was again spectacular, the sky turned orange and the sun melted into the ocean.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![The sun before it melted into the ocean](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/kota-kinabalu-038.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/kota-kinabalu-038.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">The sun before it melted into the ocean</figcaption></figure>

Another of the onsite restaurants is Teppan-yaki Kozan. Teppan-yaki is a style of Japanese cuisine where food is elaborately and artistically cooked in front of you by a chef using an iron griddle. You've got to book ahead as meals are cooked in sittings, we sat down with three generations of a Japanese family, and chose the Kumamoto menu.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Selection of sushi
*   Seabass
*   Striploin
*   Fried spinach
*   Teppan-yaki fried rice
*   Pickled vegetables
*   Miso soup
*   Kozan ice-cream of the day
</div>

Samantha sat next to a lovely Japanese grandmother, who chuckled and helped us as we apparently used our chopsticks incorrectly, dropping sushi rice and fish everywhere. The youngest child was bewildered by our ineptitude. For the rest of the meal we were self-conscious; we waited, watched and copied the family, to avoid another faux-pas.

But it was the chef that stole the show. He used cooking utensils with the skill of a martial artist. Scrape, swoosh, scrape, he moved and cooked food with precision. Steak was balanced on its fatty edge, then flipped and sealed and flame cooked in an alcohol fuelled explosion. Eggs were thrown into the air, catching the shell on his spatula — cracking it open and releasing the yolk onto the hot plate to cook, just part of our fried rice. Between juggling salt and pepper he seared our sea bass to perfection. Delightful.

By 9am it's already too hot to wander along the beach without burning your feet and getting hot and sweaty. So at 7am, before breakfast, we got up and out early for a pleasant beachside stroll. The tide was on its way out, leaving behind its treasures. In the sand we tracked lizard and snake trails, following the marks until they disappeared in the grass. But the romance ended with the onslaught of sandflies and a lack of insect repellant.

After a buffet breakfast feast we lounged in the early morning sun near. On a whim we paid to ride Segways around a dirt track circuit. Neither of us had been on one before. You lean forward to go forward, and lean back to stop, turning is as simple as leaning left or right. It's all about centre of gravity, and once you've got it it comes naturally. But until then it's a little jerky, and Sam's hilarious and calamitous forward-backwards-somersault off the front is testament to that. But we were soon zipping around the circuit, taking corners at speed and splashing through the track's water hole.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Paul on a segway](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/borneo-iphone-001.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/borneo-iphone-001.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Paul on a segway</figcaption></figure>

It gave Sam an adrenaline rush, and on the back of that she rushed over to the water-sports shed looking for more activities. She came bounding back, “Let's go parasailing!”. Given that Samantha is scared of heights, and tends to shy away from crazy activities, this came as a surprise. We had to do it now she said, so she wouldn't have time to think and back out of the whole thing.

10 minutes later we'd scrambled onto a boat, been strapped into a harness and were flying in the air beneath the rainbow colours of a parachute. Tied to the boat by a metal cable, it unwound, sending us higher and higher. We could see for miles, the expansive sea opened out in front of us, and behind us the peak of Mount Kinabalu poked out from above the clouds, detached from anything else, like a floating fortress.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Paul and Samantha beginning their parasail](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/borneo-iphone-022.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/borneo-iphone-022.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Paul and Samantha beginning their parasail</figcaption></figure>

This is all perfect preparation for a spa day. From the boat, pumped full of adrenaline, Sam sprinted to reception to board a golf buggy, destination: The Chi spa. Splashing out, she chose the Marine Elixir “chi journey”. That's a 3h30 session with pampering foot ritual, body wrap with mask and steam room. It continues with a luxurious seaweed (and rose petal) bath, a full body massage and a revitalising facial.

Meanwhile I embarked on a fully personalised nature tour; I walked where I wanted to looking for animals. By the golf course the lotus flowers looked spectacular, and at the Ocean wing sunbirds danced about the pink flowers (they're almost as tiny and as nimble as hummingbirds), by Coast I found a frightened baby scops owl that had fledged its nest too soon (it was soon in the care of the park ranger), and out the back of the hotel, with our friends from the Orangutan sanctuary, I found a giant golden orb-weaver spider. The more you look, the more you see, and for a quick midday wander I found a lot to talk about and photograph.

Rejuvenated, and somewhat calmer, Sam returned from her spa and we shared a greek wrap by the pool. Waiting for sunset and our pre-booked firefly tour, we played boules.

The firefly trip is a minibus out to a nearby river, then an hour long boat journey in pitch black. It was overcast but dry, perfect viewing conditions. Obviously at night and by water there will be many mosquitos and bitey things, so we wrapped up head-to-toe in wet weathers and trousers, and covered the rest of ourselves in deet. Sat two-by-two down a wobbly wooden boat, we peered into the dark searching for signs of light. The green light of a firefly in the distance is almost imperceptible, but when they're together in trees, pulsating in competition, the place lights up like a Christmas tree. We pulled in close, and our guide brought a few onboard, flying by our noses for us to see up close. Looking into the water you can also see the faint glow of luminescent plankton. The boat turned around and we headed back, waving goodbye to the faeries.

Back at the hotel we had a quick Nasi Goreng from the Coffee Terrace and went to bed. With the lights off, looking up at the ceiling, a faint green light flashed, and it seemed to move too. “Look Sam, a firefly is in our room!”, we got excited and I turned on the lights to get a better look. “Nope, it's just the fire alarm”.

For our third morning at Shangri-la Rasa Ria we booked a 6am summit trail and breakfast. We hoped for a gorgeous sunrise and romantic brekkie, with views of Mount Kinabalu. At the entrance to the Nature Reserve we joined two British couples and met our guide (and carrier of food). The climb to the top took about half an hour, and although it was all straight up it wasn’t too strenuous. Our guide was ready and willing to point out wildlife; on the rope bridge he showed us a stick insect, on the way down a giant golden orb-weaver, and in between a couple of squirrels and cicadas. At the peak sits a small wooden viewing platform. As we’d hoped for, there were spectacular morning views across Sabah, and the silhouette of Mount Kinabalu rose out of the mist in the distance (we were too late for sunrise, the sun was already high in the sky).

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Paul at the summit, with a view across Sabah](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/kota-kinabalu-064.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/kota-kinabalu-064.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Paul at the summit, with a view across Sabah</figcaption></figure>

The breakfast table was set back from the view in a forest clearing. Packed breakfast was fresh fruit, pastries and yoghurt. Before coming away we’d had a frantic week of looking at a flat, making an offer and preparing for purchase. On Tuesday morning we got an email, our offer had been accepted. We celebrated with our new friends at the top of the summit trail, toasting with orange juice. Breakfast attracted a large shield bug, which flew towards us and around us looking for somewhere to perch. Unfortunately for Samantha it decided to suddenly land its big beetle body on her lips; with her lips pursed shut, Sam winced and flustered until it flew away. “I could feel it in my mouth”, she said. These are the romantic moments you don’t consider when booking such idyllic things.

Down at the hotel, breakfast walked off, sweat evaporated, still hungry, we headed to air-conditioned Coast for breakfast number two. That meant a couple of glasses of prosecco, some Nasi Lemak and a noodle soup, amongst all the other buffet breakfast treats we still craved. And no bugs in sight. The rest of the day was spent lounging in the sun, relaxing by the beach, drinking cocktails, swimming in the pool, swinging in a hammock, forgetting to re-apply sun lotion. All that sort of taxing stuff.

Monitor lizards are not an uncommon sight around the hotel grounds, they’re about two feet long and plod by without you noticing. From my hammock I watched one approach a rock, not more than a metre away, and start digging. I suspected it was making itself somewhere to rest in the shade. Its dig was slow, stopping every few seconds to look around and check for danger. Finally it climbed all the way in, and that was that I thought. But then it wriggled out backwards as fast as it could, and in its jaws it held a bloated toad. Like a dog with a toy it shook its head voraciously, and viciously smacked the toad to the floor until it was dead. Then up, jaws open, blink and you’ll miss it, the lizard swallowed the toad whole. The lizard resumed its innocent plod, nothing to see here, and it skulked away into the bushes.

After a dazzling sunset (and the inevitable photo taking of orange and purple skies), and happy hour orangutan themed cocktails, we found a table at Tepi Laut Makan for a sumptuous buffet of asian street food. Its design simulates a night market, and with your plate you can visit each open-fronted store for something different; stir fries, curries, stews. We took great delight in trying all the Malaysian desserts put out for us, even those that sounded or looked like something we’d dislike.

Our last day at the Shangri-la. Although we weren’t flying to Borneo Rainforest Lodge until Thursday, we were checking out early to save ourselves some cash. Rather than stay overnight again (at some expense!), and get a 40 minute taxi to the airport at 4am in the morning, we decided to check out a day early. Instead we’d stay at the hotel all day, and get a taxi to a cheap hotel right next to the airport for one night, then fly out the next day — very early but without the long drive beforehand.

For our last breakfast we returned to Coast, for the free prosecco and bucks fizz. The eggs benedict came with two perfectly poached eggs that seemed to not stop oozing yolk. Despite Sam’s pancake, Nasi Lemak and buffet choices, she was so impressed she immediately ordered one too. Four breakfasts, why not?

The rest of the day was much the same as before, hammock swinging, poolside sunbathing, happy hour cocktails, fresh lime sodas, a very tight competitive game of boules, bird watching and sunset photography. Only this time we checked out at midday and paid for all amenities with cash. The Shangri la was an oasis of calm, a place to relax, eat fantastic food and worry only about the size of the hotel tab. A delightful slice of luxury and decadence.

We watched the sun set over the pristine sandy beach one last time, cocktails in hand, a band playing, the sky turning dark. And we looked forward to the final part of our Malaysia and Borneo holiday, when we’d travel into the depths of the jungle, come face to face with leeches and hopefully see some wild orangutans. Tomorrow we travel to the [Borneo Rainforest Lodge](/2014/05/borneo-rainforest-lodge/ "Borneo Rainforest Lodge").
