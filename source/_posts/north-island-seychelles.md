For four weeks I joined WildlifeAct’s “[Conserving Paradise](http://wildlifeact.com/volunteer/seychelles/conserving-paradise/)” project, where volunteers help with conservation of wild turtles, tortoises and endemic bird species. It's situated on the [remote North Island](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ile+du+Nord/@-4.3921463,55.2371656,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x22e016928e2f2003:0xd61b32e65bd5e526!8m2!3d-4.3949648!4d55.2452567) in the Seychelles and run by the environment office at the [North Island resort](http://www.north-island.com/). To stay at this resort costs upwards of €2,000 per person per night – and guests arrive by helicopter; volunteer quarters are much more down to earth, as are the costs.

My time here felt like volunteer work, rather than a holiday, as it comes without many of the niceties that typify a holiday; cocktails, a pool, choice of food and activities, tours, etc. It's timetabled conservation fieldwork that makes a difference, and I was not treated as a paying guest, but instead a staff member; a person that must follow all the rules.

The journey from Brighton to North Island was not trivial. The plan was a flight from London to Joburg, then Joburg to Seychelles. But South African airways delayed my first flight by 12 hours, putting me in a hotel. That delay meant a missed connection and another stopover in Joburg. "Never fly South African airways", a fellow passenger said — when that flight eventually landed there was a round of ironic applause. The catch was that the connection I missed did not run on Mondays or Tuesdays; cue SAA putting me on a flight to Dubai. After 3 flights, a taxi, two hotels, two boats, 6 hours sleep and 62 hours of travelling, I arrived on the island; jumping from a zodiac into the warm waters of the island’s East Beach. There was however a highlight; Emirates took pity on my plight and gave me a free upgrade on the final leg.

## The Island

North Island is a picture perfect paradise, with four sandy beaches, granite hills and coconut trees leaning out over the water's edge. It's a millionaire's playground, quite literally. Amongst the coconuts are large fruit bats, moorhens, skink and gecko lizards, giant aldabra tortoises, giant palm spiders, and white-tailed tropic birds. The island is surrounded by fantastic reefs, perfect for crystal clear snorkelling or diving; rays, sharks and colourful fish abound.

The island is criss-crossed with a small network of sandy roads, which staff and guests navigate using little electric buggies. On the roadside are signposts, beware of the tortoises; they move slowly and look like rocks, and there's over 80 on the island. A number of the larger ones bear the scars of a road collision.

The island used to be a coconut plantation, and projects are in place to gradually eradicate the coconuts and invasive species and recreate the island's original ecosystem, bringing back the endemics, the original plant species, bird species, and so on. That's why we're here as volunteers, to help these long-term project find their feet, with a bit of "legwork".

### The beaches

North Island has four distinct beaches, each with incredibly soft sand (a pleasure to walk on barefoot), turquoise water and picturesque overhanging coconut palms. Another feature they all share is rapid erosion during changing seasons; over 6 months East Beach will build up while West will erode; then visa versa. The environment team document it with photos. The sand is lovely, but it does get everywhere, and the smell of salty sea spray pervades everything.

#### East Beach

This is the main guest beach, all the villas, 1 through 11, look out onto it, where they'll get spectacular views of sunrise, if they're awake. This is also where the dive centre is. To the south is spa hill; with a spa, gym and a hike up to the top, the easiest place to climb to for good views.

#### West Beach

My favourite beach, a quieter stretch of sand, spanning the west coast of the island. In the morning its in the shade, which makes it pleasant for the turtle patrol. At one end is a picnic spot for guests, and at the other is sunset bar, where guests have their meals set against the red hues of a falling sun. Along the mid-section are rocks where you find large swift-footed crabs and hermit crabs.

#### Honeymoon Beach

At the south of West Beach is a 5 minute rocky walk that takes you to a secluded bay known as Honeymoon beach. Here the tide can come in swiftly and cut off access to the path, making it difficult to get back again, but it's otherwise beautiful.

#### Petit Anse (Staff Beach)

The staff beach is the beach that volunteers and staff can use for beaching, sunbathing, swimming etc, without having to worry about being in uniform. Though it's also the first beach guests see when they arrive by helicopter. It's also the least nice of all the beaches; while I was here it was monsoon season (in the traditional sense, as in a "seasonal reversing wind", and not "extreme rain"), which meant strong winds and currents were channelled through the bay, making it rough and too dangerous to swim. Staff beach is connected to honeymoon beach via the Bernica Trail, which takes about 45 minutes.

## Living as a volunteer

### Volunteer house

As a volunteer I stayed in the volunteer house, a rustic stone hut with two bedrooms (girls, boys), a small living room and a shower. Most of the furniture is cobbled together, there's some shelves and wardrobes without doors, some bunk beds, a table, a fridge, a sofa-bed and a clothes drier, the front-door doesn't stay shut unless locked. There's a hardworking but poorly performing air-conditioner which probably lowers the temperature by a degree or two, it gets left on constantly, and is often backed up with a couple of fans when it's too hot to sleep. I'd hate to think what'd happen if they broke.

The house is away from the main living area, the staff village; where some 150 staff members live. It can get quite noisy, with parties, music, and other lively activities. It's not uncommon to hear loud hip-hop and reggae music blasting from the wooden cabins. It was good not to be too close to the noise.

### Being staff, with uniform

Even though I’m a volunteer, for many purposes volunteers are treated as staff, with access to staff services. I was very much staff and not a guest, it's an important distinction, and this means following rules and wearing a uniform. When you arrive you'll receive a set of clothes that don't fit quite right; shorts, shirts, very short shorts for women – without pockets. You need to wear these wherever you go on the island, staff village and staff beach being the only exceptions.

On arrival each bag must go through the staff's rat room, checking that no bags have inadvertently reintroduced rats onto the island; rats wreak havoc on nesting bird populations, and quickly destroy ecosystems. Staff are also only allowed to bring in one bottle of alcohol.

### Food

Food is served at the Bistro, a staff buffet in the village. Every morning between 6am and 8:30am we go there for breakfast; 11:30am to 1pm for lunch; and 5:30pm to 6:45pm for dinner. There's not much choice when it comes to food, you eat what they've made; which is usually a seychelles dish of rice and fish or meat, sometimes pasta (and on saturdays there's ice cream), they're tasty and hearty meals, the portions are huge, but without much variety. I ended up craving the things I couldn’t eat, like a stone-baked pizza, chocolate or cheesecake. Because of the heat, and almost constant thirst, I felt hungry all day, even if I'd just filled my stomach with carbs.

As a volunteer you're given a plate, some cutlery, a cup and a bowl; you take them to each meal, wash it at the bistro and bring it home. "Own your plate", CJ said when I arrived.

There is a staff shop which sells some of the things I craved; simple snacks like chocolate and crisps, or necessities like shampoo, batteries and toilet roll. But it's only open for an hour 6pm to 7pm, every other day, there's always queues, and beer is limited to 3 per person. Apparently Seychelles has, in general, an alcohol problem, that and rowdy drunken staff on an un-policed island is a thing to avoid.

### Other volunteers

WildlifeAct volunteer groups are a maximum of 4 people; me, an 18 year-old Frenchman named Paul, and another fellow Brit (though originating from South Africa), Robyn. We were joined later by Lea, a young woman from Germany. Together we'd go about our volunteering duties, go to lunch, etc. There are other volunteers here too; two are on a 6 month project eradicating Indian Mynas, and also Matt, an intern who's here for 6 weeks.
