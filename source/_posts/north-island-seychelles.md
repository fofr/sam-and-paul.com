For four weeks I joined WildlifeAct’s “[Conserving Paradise](http://wildlifeact.com/volunteer/seychelles/conserving-paradise/)” project, where volunteers help with conservation of wild turtles, tortoises and endemic bird species. It's situated on the [remote North Island](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ile+du+Nord/@-4.3921463,55.2371656,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x22e016928e2f2003:0xd61b32e65bd5e526!8m2!3d-4.3949648!4d55.2452567) in the Seychelles and run by the environment office at the [North Island resort](http://www.north-island.com/). To stay at this resort costs upwards of €2,000 per person per night – and guests arrive by helicopter; volunteer quarters are much more down to earth, as are the costs.

It should also be considered volunteer work, rather than a holiday, as it comes without many of the niceties that typify a holiday; cocktails, a pool, choice of food and activities, tours, etc. It's timetabled conservation fieldwork that makes a difference, and you wont be treated as a paying guest, but instead a staff member.

The journey from Brighton to North Island was not trivial. The plan was a flight from London to Joburg, then Joburg to Seychelles. But South African airways delayed my first flight by 12 hours, putting me in a hotel. That delay meant a missed connection and another stopover in Joburg. "Never fly South African airways", a fellow passenger said, when that flight landed there was a round of ironic applause. The catch here is that the connection I missed did not run on Mondays or Tuesdays; cue SAA putting me on a flight to Dubai. After 3 flights, a taxi, two hotels, two boats, 6 hours sleep and 62 hours of travelling, I arrived on the island; jumping from a zodiac into the warm waters of the island’s East Beach. There was a highlight however; Emirates took pity on my plight and gave me a free upgrade on the final leg.

## The Island

North Island is a picture perfect paradise, with four sandy beaches, granite hills and coconut trees leaning out over the water's edge. It's a millionaire's playground, quite literally. Amongst the coconuts are large fruit bats, moorhens, skink and gecko lizards, giant aldabra tortoises, giant palm spiders, and white-tailed tropic birds. The island is surrounded by fantastic reefs, perfect for crystal clear snorkelling or diving; rays, sharks and colourful fish abound.

The island is criss-crossed with a small network of sandy roads, which staff and guests navigate using little electric buggies. On the roadside are signposts, beware of the tortoises; they move slowly and look like rocks, and there's over 80 on the island. A number of the larger ones bear the scars of a road collision.

The island used to be a coconut plantation, and a project is in place to gradually eradicate the coconuts and recreate the island's original ecosystem, bringing back all the original plant species, bird species, and so on. That's why we're here as volunteers, to help this long-term project find its feet, with a bit of "legwork", pun intended.

### The beaches

North Island has four distinct beaches, each with incredibly soft sand, turquoise water and picturesque overhanging coconut palms. Another feature they all share is rapid erosion during changing seasons; over 6 months East Beach will build up while West will erode; then visa versa. The environment team document this with photos. The sand is lovely, but it does get everywhere, and the smell of salty sea spray pervades everything.

#### East Beach

This is the main guest beach, all the villas, 1 through 11, look out onto it, where they'll get spectacular views of sunrise, if they're awake.

#### West Beach

My favourite beach, a quieter stretch of sand, spanning the west coast of the island. In the morning its in the shade, which makes it pleasant for the turtle patrol. Along the mid-section are rocks where you find large swift-footed crabs and hermit crabs.

#### Honeymoon Beach

At the south of West Beach is a 5 minute rocky walk that takes you to a secluded bay known as Honeymoon beach. Here you need to be wary of the tide, it can come in right to the edge and it can be difficult to get back again, but its otherwise beautiful.

#### Petit Anse (Staff Beach)

The staff beach is the beach that volunteers and staff can use for beaching, sunbathing, swimming etc, without having to worry about being in uniform. Though it's also the first beach guests see when they arrive by helicopter. It's also the least nice of all the beaches; while I was here it was monsoon season (in the traditional sense, as in a "seasonal reversing wind", and not "extreme rain"), which meant strong winds and currents were channelled through the bay, making it rough and too dangerous to swim.

## Living as a volunteer

### Volunteer house

As a volunteer I stayed in the volunteer house, a rustic stone hut with two bedrooms (girls, boys), a small living room and a shower. Most of the furniture is cobbled together, there's some shelves and wardrobes without doors, some bunk beds, a table, a fridge, a sofa-bed and a clothes drier, the front-door doesn't stay shut unless locked. There's a hardworking but poorly performing air-conditioner which probably lowers the temperature by a degree or two, it gets left on constantly, and is often backed up with a couple of fans when it's too hot to sleep. I'd hate to think what'd happen if they broke.

The house is away from the main living area, the staff village; where some 150 staff members live. It can get quite noisy, with parties, music, and other lively activities. We're outside of that, close to the environment office, away from the hustle and bustle, which I personally preferred.

### Being staff, with uniform

Even though I’m a volunteer, for many purposes volunteers are treated as staff, with access to staff services. I was very much staff and not a guest, it's an important distinction, and this means wearing a uniform. When you arrive you'll receive a set of clothes that don't fit quite right; shorts, shirts, very short shorts for women – without pockets. You need to wear these wherever you go on the island, staff village and staff beach being the only exceptions.

On arrival each bag must go through the staff's rat room, checking that no bags have inadvertently reintroduced rats onto the island; rats wreak havoc on nesting bird populations, and quickly destroy ecosystems, as history shows us. Staff are also only allowed to bring back one bottle of alcohol to this closed environment, so they check for that here too.

### Food

Food is served at the Bistro, a staff buffet in the village. Every morning between 6am and 8:30am we go there for breakfast; 11:30am to 1pm for lunch; and 5:30pm to 6:45pm for dinner. There's not much choice when it comes to food, you eat what they've made; which is usually a seychelles dish of rice and fish or meat, sometimes pasta (and on saturdays there's ice cream), they're tasty and hearty meals, the portions are huge, but without much variety. You end up craving the things you aren't eating, like a stone-baked pizza, chocolate or cheesecake. Because of the heat, and almost constant thirst, it feels like you're hungry all day, even if you've filled your stomach with carbs.

As a volunteer you're given a plate, some cutlery, a cup and a bowl; you take them to each meal, wash it at the bistro and bring it home. "Own your plate", CJ said when I arrived.

There is a staff shop which sells some of the things you might crave; some simple snacks like chocolate and crisps, or necessities like shampoo, batteries and toilet roll. But it's only open for an hour 6pm to 7pm, every other day, there's always queues, and beer is limited to 3 per person. Apparently Seychelles has, in general, an alcohol problem, that and rowdy drunken staff is a thing to avoid.

### Other volunteers

WildlifeAct volunteer groups are a maximum of 4 people; me, an 18 year-old Frenchman named Paul, and another fellow Brit (though originating from South Africa), Robyn. We were joined later by Lea, a young woman from Germany. Together we'd go about our volunteering duties, go to lunch, etc. There are other volunteers here too; two are on a 6 month project eradicating Indian Mynas, and also Matt, an intern who's here for 6 weeks.

## Volunteer activities

Each day is broken up into 4 loose slots; two morning sessions, two afternoon sessions and 2h30 for lunch – it's so hot at midday all you can do is rest. The morning sessions begin at 7am, which sounds early but is the nicest time of day, half an hour after dawn, when the air is still comfortably cool.

"Island time" means the slots don't last as long as they should, or start later, or they get swapped around, or there's simply no activity to do; it's all very relaxed, well, until something overruns or someone can't do something because they don't have a buggy, or a GPS, or some other vital tool – and then everyone gets tense and you realise how poorly it's all managed.

### Turtle patrol

{% figure seychelles-tagging-turtle-tracks.jpg landscape %}

{% endfigure %}

This is my favourite activity on North Island, and it's the first activity every morning. After breakfast we take the buggy, and split up, heading out to each of the islands four beaches. Our job is to walk the beach, to see if any turtles have emerged overnight; we take with us a bag for rubbish, and a pack of tools incase a turtle has visited; a log book, a GPS recorder, a tape measure, and a marker pen. (There's one pack for four people and four beaches, so if there's lots of activity it can take a while).

If a turtle has emerged it's very obvious, there will be a track that comes from the sea, probably leading to a body pit or a nest site, and then back again. In August it's predominantly green turtles that are nesting, the island has both green turtles and hawksbill turtles, but typically when one is laying, the other isn't; that's what the data collected by volunteers shows.

A green turtle can weigh about 200-300kg (whereas the hawksbill is ~70kg), and it leaves tracks about 1m across. We use the tape measure to get an indication of their size. Green turtles typically emerge overnight, presumably so their large body can stay cool and they don't get caught out in the hot sun.

When they find a spot they dig to create a body pit and an egg chamber, up to a metre deep, to lay their eggs. Green turtles lay 100 or so eggs at once, not all of them fertilised. While laying eggs the turtles are in a trance like state, they continue until all eggs have been laid. This is the point at which a turtle can be tagged with a titanium metal identifier. After digging and laying they cover the eggs and spend a long time disguising where the nest is. They throw sand in all directions and make disturbances in the sand. The disguise is mostly to prevent their eggs from being predated by crabs. Crabs swarm around disturbances in sand, looking for a meal. Around many nests there are crab holes, but they don't always find the eggs; this predation is natural and is not prevented. Sometimes you can find the egg shells lying on the beach where crabs have gotten to them and dug them up.

When we find a nest we mark it with wooden stakes, and on a coconut write the species of turtle, the nest number and the date. Then we save a GPS location for it.

{% figure seychelles-turtle-track-logs.jpg portrait %}

{% endfigure %}

Some turtle digs get abandoned and we don't find a nest – the sand might be too soft, and keep falling back in, preventing the pit from being deep enough, or it might have obstructions like plant roots, in these cases a turtle will usually abandon its effort and return to the sea without laying. One particular turtle however made a mammoth effort, she climbed the beach and began digging, but the site wasn't right, so moved on, she made 5 attempts, and left a turtle track over 100m long; the poor turtle must have been exhausted – at one point, after 3 digs, it looks like she's heading back to sea, but she doubles back to try twice more, all unsuccessful; poor thing. We still save a GPS location, but mark is as an emergence rather than a nest.

#### Seeing a green turtle

I was fortunate enough to see a green turtle on west beach. After an evening of star photography (the milky way is astounding here), I joined Robyn and we sat on the beach and waited. Beneath the moonlight and stars, we watched for the emergence of a vague dark object from the ocean depths, like witnessing an ancient  ritual we don't fully comprehend. For hours we watched the waves, every coconut or rock starts to look like a turtle. We didn't see anything so headed to Honeymoon beach to try our luck there, no turtles.

At 10:30pm we were going to call it a night, but now that the guests had left Sunset Bar at the far end of west beach, it was worth looking here too. Walking along beach we heard a distant noise, it sounded like something was digging or pushing sand, and we were immediately excited. Following the sea along the beach we found a turtle trail, which didn't have a return path – it was definitely a turtle and it was definitely still on the beach.

Green turtles are sensitive to light, so we didn't use torches or flash photography. Typically the moon had now set, so there was complete darkness. The only light was coming from the milky way high above us, the shining heart of our galaxy illuminating nature doing its thing. Above the turtle three shooting stars passed by.

From the trail we listened intently for the turtle's activity, the digging had stopped as soon as we arrived. We hoped this meant it was laying, we followed the tracks up the beach, stopping short of the vegetation and keeping a respectful distance, as we'd been told. We didn't want to disturb the turtle, it needed to finish its laying and then disguise the eggs. We waited patiently, without moving, for an hour as it pushed sand about, with the occasional noise of her smacking a coconut. In the complete darkness the crabs couldn't see us, one particularly large one inched closer, we had a coconut to scare it away, just in case.

Without any warning, a large dark object appeared from the vegetation and begun moving toward us. We kept our lights off and strained our eyes to see this magnificent creature. It edged ever closer to us, and passed to our left within 2m, stopping to rest right besides us, for a moment it looked as us, inquisitively, then it carried on, 2 strokes then rest, 2 strokes then rest, all the way down to the sea. We quietly followed it, sticking to its blind spots, and watched as it swum away, another shooting star punctuated its disappearance.

### Tortoises

There are over 80 tortoises on the island, with three dominant males; Patrick, Harry and Brutus. By the volunteer house there's a pen for the young, who would otherwise be at risk of getting hit by a buggy driving too fast.

As a volunteer it's our job to regularly find as many of the tortoises as we can. When found we note the number on their rear, GPS tag their location, and indicate their current activity – eating, resting, "active", etc. Number 38 likes to hang around the volunteer house, often drinking from the leaky tap out the back.

### Snorkelling

The reefs are ideal for snorkelling, but the activity depends on the weather, the sea's roughness and visibility in the water. While snorkelling is often seen as a recreational activity for volunteers, there is some work here too; there's a compact camera with a waterproof case that should be taken out and used to photograph the variety of fish species around the coral. Back at the environment office the species can then be identified and saved in a spreadsheet along with their pictures.

As a poor swimmer, and with waves that often break above my head, I opted out of the snorkelling – one particular wave flattened me and I almost lost flippers and mask. I'm not confident enough to swim out to the coral without a lifeguard or anyone on watch, in case I get into trouble. This is kind of a bummer, as water is the best way to cool down in the stifling heat, and the island's best wildlife is in the surrounding reefs. Many volunteers also take part in dive training, and some have taken the open water exam here. But that's all too advanced for me; I'd prefer calm water with a shallow gradient to find my bearings, or a pool.

### Vegetation



### Coconut removal

### Indian Myna eradication

While not a volunteer activity for us, this was a big conservation project taking place while we were there. And yes, eradication means killing.

The Indian Myna bird is an invasive species, originally introduced to help catch bugs when the island was a coconut plantation. They are aggressive birds and actively harass many struggling endemic species; for instance the seychelles wren; the myna will attack the bird and peck its head, causing brain damage, and it will turf out eggs from its nest. To encourage sea bird species to return, and to begin reintroduction programmes for other at risk birds, the mynas must first be removed. It's not logistically possible to remove them from the island and take them somewhere else; they are humanely killed instead.

This project has its own dedicated volunteers, two students for one month, and now two new volunteers who will be on the island for 6 months.
