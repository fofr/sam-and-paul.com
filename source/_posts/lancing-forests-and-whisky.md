Taking a break from planning a holiday, or stressful thoughts about buying a flat, and taking one last opportunity to relax before Sam's exams, we took a drive along the coast to Lancing and Worthing. Then in the week we saw the world premiere of Neil LaBute's "In a forest dark and deep" and I topped it off with a Whisky flight at The Albannach.

### Lancing

As a break from all the holiday planning and house hunting, we took a Sunday drive along the coast, from Brighton, West to Lancing and Worthing.

From the A27 we spotted a large cathedral on the south downs. Trying to reach it, we took a small country lane which gradually took us further and further away from our intended destination, a detour up and over the hills, affording spectacular sea views. We stopped at the top for a very windy stroll.

Back down the hill, through the narrow one way lanes, back in a circle. Take two. We turned left instead of straight on and found ourselves at Lancing College with its towering chapel and ornate school buildings. The chapel was open to the public, and by ourselves, we toured the crypt, pulpit et al. Some gloves sat on the back of a chair.

Post-photography and tuna mayo sandwiches, we drove West, along the coast, into the sun and towards Worthing, passing the pier and stopping by the sea.

The tide was out and where the pebbles stopped we found sand! Sand! Who’d have thought there’d be sand here! Birds nibbled at sea creatures as the sun began to dip. We bought a fresh flat fish from the fisherman and, back at home in Brighton, made homemade fish and chips as the sun, a glowing ball of red, dipped behind Worthing in the distance.

### In a forest dark and deep

A long time ago, when Sam had a little more free time, she signed up to numerous theatre newsletters, the emails keep coming. One such email included bargainous deals to see Neil LaBute’s new play, world premiering at the Vaudeville, “In a forest dark and deep”. Starring Matthew Fox (Lost) and Olivia Williams (Dollhouse) as sibling rivals in a dark comedy. The kicker? An invite to a post-show Q & A session with Matthew, Olivia and Neil.

We’d seen Fat Pig a short while back, and knew we enjoyed LaBute’s work, and “In a forest” did not disappoint. Whilst not wanting to spoil anything, it had Metallica, a lot of swearing, audience alienation (in a good way), and a lot of fighting. Both Sam and I highly recommend it, its run ends in June.

The Q & A gave us a fascinating insight into the ongoing work at the early stages of a new production, chopping bits out, making other parts flow better, responding to audience reaction, getting the script “locked down” and preparing for press night.

In a very English accent, this was thoroughly enjoyable.

### Albannach Whisky Flight

I’ve never been into Whisky, probably because I’m young and just hadn’t given it a chance. I missed the last Whisky outing some friends organised, so I wasn’t going to miss this one. At the Albannach, with its Scottish menu and antler themed interior, we sat in candlelight, Trafalgar Square just outside the window.

Five of us ordered the Whisky Tour, five 250ml samples covering the lowlands, highlands, Speyside, Campbeltown and Orkney. I preferred the darker, smoother Whiskies, the 12yr Old Pulteney was a common favourite, as was the Mortlach 16yr. Until now I couldn’t distinguish one Whisky from another, but having five samples to compare helped me pick out the subtle (and not so subtle) differences; spiciness, lightness, smoothness, loch-ness (Scottish pun, my bad).

Obviously with this much Whisky we needed some food, the braised rabbit leg was very tasty, as was the Cullen Skink (smoked haddock and potato soup) starter. 

In other news, Whisky doesn’t go particularly well with a burger, and Haggis Carpaccio wouldn’t be very pleasant, if anywhere was to ever serve such a thing. The long awaited cheese boards (half an hour to slice some cheese!?) gave us another tasting round, with quince (“The artist formerly known as”), fig and grapes.
