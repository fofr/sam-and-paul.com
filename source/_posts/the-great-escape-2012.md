One year on and it's another Great Escape Festival in Brighton. Over 300 bands across 30 venues. Of course, over the past month or so I've been listening to a festival playlist to work out the best bands to see, and on Monday we got the gig planner, with the usual news that bands we want to see are clashing.

As [like last year](http://www.sam-and-paul.com/2011/06/the-great-escape-2011/), Sarah and Mark joined us from Bristol for the three days. And at midday on Thursday we set into town to grab our wrist bands and programmes, via co-op for some tasty fresh croissants. At Jubilee Square the TGE staff struggle to snap on each of our cotton itchy-feeling wrist bands.

<small>The Great Escape 2012 lineup</small>

The first set we wanted to see was at The Prince Albert, back up towards the station, a small but famous venue that we missed out on last year. Climbing the narrow staircase, we entered our first gig of the festival. Wow, this place is tiny, and packed. We squeezed through to the back, and stood beneath a fan to stay cool, it was already very hot inside.

**Big Wave Riders** were up first, a band from Helsinki, this was their first show abroad. Echoes, waves, and experimental rhythms. They were a good opener to our day. From the back Sam couldn't see much, and we held our lagers, bopping our heads along to the beats.

**François and the Atlas Mountains** filled the stage next, on the small stage they were really very cramped. Sam and I had been playing their album beforehand, "E Volo Love", dancing around the living room to "Les Plus Beaux", as if we were on top of the pops. French lyrics meld with a joyous african rhythm, to create something lovely. But the performance wasn't without hindrance, a mic broke, and many songs were interrupted with white noise or feedback. The band shone through these technical problems, "these things happen", François said.

**Porcelain Raft** are one of my favourite bands at the moment. I'd seen them live with M83 but hadn't heard their album at that point. "Is it too deep for you?" and "Backwords" are fantastic, wistful, hypnotic, dreamy songs. Perhaps I'd hyped them up too much, but this set was awful, not that I fault the band themselves. The Prince Albert was full, people were squeezing in, it was hot and humid, we wanted lunch and it was overwhelming, but not in a good way. The two piece struggled to cope with The Prince Albert's sound setup: the snares were penetrating and the lyrics became drowned out, the balance was all wrong, not to mention the earthy buzz that surrounded everything. It was also very loud and we'd forgotten our ear plugs. Simply the wrong atmosphere and environment for this relaxing music.

We'd planned to stay on for College, the queues were heading out the building and around the corner. But we were desperate for some food and I couldn't stand another act suffering the same fait, we trickled out down the fire escape and set out for lunch. At Pompoko, opposite the corn exchange, we sat by the door and shared Japanese takoyaki with Buta/Tori Chilli Don.

Eager for more music we stopped by at our favourite Queens Hotel venue, a downstairs carpeted venue where you can sit back and listen to whoever is playing. We opened our festival here last year. This time we caught the end of AlicebanD and Canvas Wall, introduced by a local radio station and part of the Alternate Escape.

It was overcast, the clouds were heavy and there was faint mist. We went home, had a 30 minute nap, some coffee and back out again for the evening sessions.

First up, Sticky Mike's Frog Bar for **Young Dreams**. Downstairs, in the dark, another small venue, we stood right at the front in the middle, Sam would at least see one band without some tall guy getting in the way. Described as tropicalia, psychedelic rock, they combined synths, guitars and tambourines with a pop sensibility. Their self-titled track, "Young Dreams", stood out from the set, it was excellent.

**New Look** followed, a two piece haling from Canada. Futuristic, minimal pop laced with dubstep. Their self-titled album attracted me, "The Ballad" standing out. As a live act, Sarah Ruba looked gorgeous in 1940s attire, alongside her smartly dressed buttoned up collar husband, Adam Pavao. Together they played their minimal pop, as patterns of light danced across the stage. But the set lacked energy, and began to sound 'same-y', it was perhaps too minimal. Not until the final track, "Teen Need", did we really see what they were capable of.

Next up, the Pavilion Theatre for Club Uncut, a favourite venue of ours from last year. We intended to see Willy Mason, but arrived to join the back of an enormous queue. Oh dear. In the cold and dark, we stood, waiting to get in. "You have zero chance of getting in", a security fella kept telling us and everyone else, "it's been one in one out for the last hour". That was great, he made people leave the queue and we moved closer. Willy Mason's set started, we didn't get in, but then we also wanted to see Django Django, up later. We considered the Corn Exchange and Mystery Jets, but hedged our bets on people leaving when Willy was done. And it paid off, we made it in.

We got in before **TOY** started, a krautrock post-rock act with long hair, with a singer that sounded like a heavy Jarvis Cocker. Despite all that we really enjoyed their 7 minute epic tracks. A pleasant surprise.

Next up were **Django Django**, headlining the evening, a Scottish quartet, "art-rock that melds intangible electronic flourishes to the visceral rub of live instrumentation". You could also describe them as psychedelic rock, a concoction of 80s rhythm and 60s beach boy-esque vocal harmonies. Either way, I think they're awesome, and enjoyed the set immensely, dancing like a fool to all the tracks, even to the Egyptian themed "Skies over Cairo".

In the fog we walked home, our legs tired from standing all day. Day one over. Two days to go.

Before heading out on day two, Sam whipped up some chilli and nachos for lunch. We didn't want to be starving in the middle of a set again. The sun also decided to make an appearance. The foggy overcast scenes of Thursday were replaced with fluffy clouds and blue skies, for the first time in weeks.

We wandered down Queen Street and West Street, following the signs for The Warren, a small venue tucked in behind Churchill Square and a multi-storey car park. But through the entrance lay a sunny garden and outdoor bar, in the midst of a church spire. Decorated with Lewis Carroll paraphernalia, it was a hidden little wonderland. With drinks, we sat on beer kegs waiting for the next act, we just missed the end of Dante.

The reason we were here was **Husky**, a band Mark had heard recently on 6music. The Paul Simon parallels in the programme drew us in further. An Australian blend of folk, classic pop, soft harmonies and the occasional keyboard solo made for a charming set. The venue was so quiet, everyone in the room was here to see them, if only all settings were as harmonious.

Up next on The Guardian's "new band of the day" stage, were a London act called **Duologue**. Four guys, without their bassist, but a violinist, sampler, singer and guitarist. With a sparse electronic rhythm, deep bass, crisp male vocals and the crescendos of violin and guitar, this experimental rock band created something lovely. They played songs from their EP "A - B".

The final act of this session at The Warren were the clean cut **Swiss Lips**, with their own brand of 90s dance-pop. I can't say I enjoyed this set, and put my earplugs in to numb the noise.

With the sun out, we spent an hour or so on the pebbly beach, letting the time whisk by, waiting until we were hungry for dinner. We threw pebbles at beer cans but never hit them. Just around the corner we repeated last year's proceedings with dinner at Pho, specialising in vietnamese street food. A baby at the table opposite stared at us, as Mark tried his Weasel coffee.

Not wanting to miss out on Grimes, we got to Digital on the sea front before it opened. A short queue formed, but we guaranteed ourselves a great spot inside. Upstairs, an orange seated area looks out on the sea from one direction, and out across the venue from the other, with a perfect unhindered view of the stage. Before the first act had started a large queue had formed outside, and the venue was packed.

I was quite excited about **My Best Fiend**, I'd starred their opening track "Higher Palms" on Spotify, it was a stand out track from the Great Escape playlist. With atmospheric keyboards, gritty guitars and emotional alt-rock male vocals, this should have been fantastic. But the set was a little flat, the beautiful lyrics washed away with heavy bass.

Canadian trio **Half Moon Run** were next, a technically awesome indie rock band with an incredible drummer; with one hand and foot he played drums, with another he played the keyboard, and then he sung at the same time. Mind blowing talent, Sam was so impressed she bought the CD and asked about his musical training. The crowd were loving them, and they played a killer set. When it was cut short, even with Grimes coming up next, there were boos, everyone wanting more. But Digital were keeping to a strict schedule, no doubt to finish in time for a Friday night club night.

And now the big act, the one we'd all been wanting to see at this festival, **GRIMES**! A one woman act with samplers, a keyboard and a microphone. Claire Boucher in a t-shirt bearing the anarchy symbol and sporting a pink fringe, played her dark and dreamy Visions album. Two amateurish arm waving dancers set the scene on stage and there were roars of delight when the intro to "Oblivion" began.

The only downside to this performance is that it wasn't longer, a light 30 minutes, an hour would have been more suiting. We all wanted more. At the end, Digital emptied, the place deserted, but reaching full again by the time YACHT turned up.

I'd seen **YACHT** before at Hoxton Bar, and I ranked it as one of the best gigs I'd ever been to. YACHT's music is good on record, but it really comes alive when performed, enhanced by the energy and antics of the band members. They're electro dystopian disco is matched with flying microphones, odd dance moves and a singer that likes to tie herself up in cables. Aye-ye-aye-ye-aye-ya, "Psychic City", was the highlight, with its singable chorus and party-starting lyrics. "We're having fun now, aren't we?", singer Claire Evans asks. We agreed, the set was brilliant.

Still raring to go, we marched over to Pavilion Theatre for a very different experience: **Blanck Mass**. A 45 minute non-stop set of complex atmospherics and ambient electronics, themed on cerebral hypoxia. One man act, Ben Power, stood centre stage and barely moved as strong green lights shone from behind, creating a silhouette amidst the smoke machines. Whirls of smoke and patterns of light accompanied slow changing drone layers, the occasional hidden rhythm emerging from the noise, and disappearing again. Exhausted I shut my eyes and rested with Sam, embracing the wall of sound. It was excellent, all we lacked was a sofa or bed.

**Forest Swords** were on a midnight. An hour long set of disparate spectral techno accompanied with a video. By now we were too tired for this, and a drunken heckler shouting "sea bass, kick him in the ass" destroyed any atmosphere we could've absorbed. Leaving early, I ate my pain au chocolat saved from lunch time and we headed home.

<!--nextpage-->

And to the final day of The Great Escape. We packed our tuna sandwiches and strolled down to The Prince Albert to catch the first act of the day, **MMOTHS**. Dreamlike electronica, and a gentle start to the day, at the less than bursting venue, where the sound and temperature were all as you would hope. A good Prince Albert experience and I came away wanting to hear more.

Last year we enjoyed watching the energetic ramblings of **22**, as they punched a hole in the Queen's Hotel roof. Not our sort of music, but a good show nonetheless, we caught them jumping around, performing guitar battles again at Komedia. The dark underground venue with its dank wooden floor was a better setting for this maniacal act. I guess they're best described as Norwegian nu-metal math pop (maybe?).

We met up with Mark's friend from Bristol, Luke and set off again, now five-strong. Sam wanted to catch Bwani Junction, so we hastily walked to Horatio's on the pier, to find the venue closed and all acts moved to The Warren. We'd been keeping an eye out for tweets to avoid things like this, and we weren't particularly happy. Starving, I pulled out my tuna sandwich for lunch. Do not ever eat a fish sandwich on the pier.

Heading back along the wooden slats, a winged beast swooped from behind, scratching my neck, grabbing my sandwich and escaping with 50% of the loot. Blasted seagull!

Digital was the nearest venue so we nipped in to catch the Australian acts performing. On stage were the unscheduled **Red Ink**, soulful alternative R&B. We moved upstairs and resumed our balcony seating. We grabbed a free CD at the end of the set, along with one of the Agent Side Grinder samplers that was lying around. (We heard they were 'excellent' with their analogue electronics and programmed drums).

**Chet Faker** appeared next with his own brand of lo-fi electronic soul and No Diggity cover. He normally plays with a band, but a long way from home, he was a one man act with samplers, et al. Playing just his third European gig, he was brilliant.

The final act of the session was **Jinja Safari**, a mad quintet that leaped around with citars playing some form of indie pop. Their energy created a good show, but the music was all a little normal.

In the sun we lay on the beach again, skimming the few flat pebbles across the sea, bounce, bounce, plunk. The dinner break took place at Zizzi's. With pizza and pasta we got to know Luke a little better, and I mixed my earlier beers with a tasty cabernet sauvignon, always a sensible concoction.

Back on the paths again, we returned to Sticky Mike's Frog Bar for Luke's choice of act, **The Suicide of Western Culture**, hailing from Barcelona. You wouldn't expect it, but this act had a political video accompanying their music. Fancy that. Post-electro post-rock instrumentalists in black hoodies, nodding above their equipment, they engineered an awesome cinematic wall of sound that we all enjoyed, except Sam who took a seat upstairs.

For the final leg of the festival we visited Coalition, another under-the-arches seafront venue. We caught **Husky** again, the setting wasn't so good this time, but it was nice recognising their songs. Of course, their album still wasn't out yet.

Country singer-songwriter **Jodie Marie** came next. Her voice was refreshing but it wasn't anything spectacular. The rowdy bar and filling venue wasn't the best setting for a girl and guitarist. (For this reason we also skipped out on Slow Club who would be playing the same venue later).

By now the venue was packed, it was sweaty and humid, like a rainforest filled with apes, or something. The schedule was running behind by 45 minutes or so. Everyone had arrived to watch We Are Scientists, but **Theme Park** were just getting started. A new, British indie rock band, likened to Talking Heads, they had some trouble with microphones on stage, and they showed a lack of experience. But their songs came through this mess, "Wax" and "Milk" being the standout songs. And when they found their flow they were enjoyable.

The final act of our night were the Coalition headliners, **We Are Scientists** from New York. A three piece - front man-George Clooney-lookalike, the dry comedian and the drummer. Indie, rock, alt-rock, jump about, shout about, their 45 minute set packed a punch, including their popular festival titled track, "The Great Escape".

And that was that, we tried to get in to EMA at the Pavilion but the delay meant we couldn't get in. We said goodbye to Luke who ran for his train and we called it a night, heading home at 1am for a cup of tea and a chat.

As you might expect, Sunday was a muted experience. We had a full English breakfast and coffee to recover. Luckily the TV had a healthy sport lineup. The Spanish Grand prix followed by the finale to the Premier League season.

Sarah and Sam nipped out to look at some of the nearby artist open houses, but returned quickly needing the loo. Mark and I watched the grand prix, as Hamilton fought his way up the leader board, and as Alonso chased first place but ultimately failed. Williams got their first, much needed, win in four years.

And then we caught the football action with Gabby on football focus. Man City and Man United were vying to be champions; equal on points but Man City ahead on goal difference. QPR and Bolton were fighting to avoid relegation, QPR playing Man City being the choice fixture. What a day of football. The QPR match was intense, with Man United winning, Man City needed to beat QPR, it looked good, 1-0 up at half time, until Cisse got an equaliser, Joey Barton got sent off and Mackie then, surprisingly, put QPR ahead. Man City fans had their heads in their hands, United's were cheering.

2-1 down, the clock turned to the 90th minute. Man City were down and out and United's game finished. 4 minutes of added time. In the 92nd minute Dzeko equalised. Some hope at least. In the 94th minute Ballotelli poked the ball through to Aguero who slotted home, with almost the last kick of the season Man City beat QPR to win the league. Exhilarating, I relived the drama on match of the day. Pure unadulterated sporting drama.
