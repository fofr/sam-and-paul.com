> "This is Zululand, not Disneyland"

For 8 weeks, following my [4 weeks volunteering in Seychelles](/2016/08/north-island-seychelles/), I travelled to South Africa to join WildlifeAct’s “[Endangered Species Conservation](http://wildlifeact.com/volunteer/south-africa/endangered-species-conservation/)” projects. Every two weeks I'd be on a different game reserve, the first of these was [Hluhluwe–Imfolozi Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hluhluwe%E2%80%93Imfolozi_Park) (HIP). _Hluhluwe_ is pronounced roughly as " shu-shlu-way", with a bit of a slur.

WildlifeAct volunteer groups are a maximum of 5 people; me, a young German guy – Jannes, a kiwi who’s been travelling around southern Africa – Claire, a Parisienne that hates Paris – Philippine, and a Dutch girl – Feline. We’d ride together on the back of the WildlifeAct truck, live together, and cook for each other. Our monitor was Kelsey – a lively and outspoken South African from the cape. We also met "Zulu warrior" Marumo, who picked us up, took us shopping and showed us the ropes before leaving for [Somkhanda](http://africaninsight.co.za/somkhanda-game-reserve/).

Each of the reserves are in the East of South Africa, in the [KwaZulu-Natal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal) region, to the north it borders Mozambique, in the South it borders Swaziland and Lesotho. Part of it used to be the [Zulu empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_Kingdom). Zulu is a spoken language here, and many traditional beliefs, practices and superstitions are maintained.

## Entering iMfolozi

On Monday, from Richard’s Bay airport where many volunteers had just arrived, and from Fish Eagle Inn – a small hotel with lots of dogs that I'd stopped overnight at, the 5 of us, plus WildlifeAct rep’ Tarryn, drove North in an Igula Tours van. We  past the paper and timber farms, up to iMfolozi.

We met Marumo and the pristine white WildlifeAct truck at Phumula Lodge, and before heading to camp we needed to buy our week’s food. At Pick n’ Pay we filled a trolley with potatoes, apples, rice, oranges, bananas, venison, cereal and so on, oh and some last minute beer, that turned out to be non-alcoholic. Buying enough food for 6, for a week, and not knowing what each other likes, was our first challenge.

The drive from Phumula Lodge to the camp was a further 1h30, from the corridor road we turned off and entered through Nyalazi gate. It was 6pm, the sunset was a dazzling red, and on the horizon Jupiter and Venus could be seen above the distant hills. It wasn’t long before we got our first wildlife sightings. By the gate we saw our first white rhino, with calf, then another, and another, then elephants. Marumo drove quickly, from the tarmac roads to the dirt ones, and onwards, the wind blew through us, and the evening turned chilly, she slowed for impala and rabbits in the road; a hyena crossed in front of us. We arrived, I hopped out and opened the gate. Home for the next two weeks.

## WildlifeAct volunteer camp

Our camp is basic but it has everything we need, well, most of the time.

There's a room for guys, a room for gals a spare room and the monitor’s room. Between them is our kitchen, with a gas stove, two sinks, some shelves, and a couple of fridges and freezers. Outside there are two showers; lockable rooms surrounded in corrugated iron each with a hose pipe tied to the roof – it works. There’s two toilets, but only one works. There’s some outdoor decking, it’s shaded and it’s where we sit on green plastic garden furniture to eat our dinners.

Power comes from a generator between certain hours, outside those we can use solar, or a battery charged from solar. Some appliances don't work on solar, like kettles and toasters. Sometimes the generator doesn’t kick-on, and most of the time we leave camp before it’s due to. Often the solar battery is drained and there’s no power, which means getting dressed in the dark and using torches to check for snakes and scorpions.

The region is experiencing a drought, there’s not much, if any, water. When we arrived the water stopped. Rather than clear liquid flowing from the taps, we had a muddy thick substance that looked like hot chocolate, it clogged up the hot water, the toilets and the showers, each needed fixing. But we coped fine; we filled containers from _jojo_ bins that had collected rainwater, we showered from buckets, we flushed _occasionally_.

## Day 1 – Telemetry and lions

It’s the beginning of spring, which brings with it cold early mornings and scorching hot afternoons. Our stonewalled rooms have no ceiling fans or air conditioning. After my first sweaty night beneath a mosquito net, and after seeing the morning light poke through the glass doors, I got up at 7am and we began our day of training. 7am would turn out to be a lie-in.

The views from camp are astounding. Beyond the wire fence and trees lies a lookout point. From a precarious rock we can see out across the dry Black Umfolozi riverbed, the view stretches from the river, past the trees and out to the distant hills beyond. "You can come down here during the day, but never at night", Kelsey warns us. Dangerous creatures have been known to come up here. The rock resembles one from a movie, all we needed was a baboon to hold up a baby lion and some music playing "Circle of life".

{% figure imfolozi-view-from-camp.jpg landscape %}

We were shown a WildlifeAct video introduction, we had a project intro by monitor Kelsey, and were told about the emergency procedures. There’s a volunteer phone which can be used to call emergency 24hour support – we can give them GPS co-ordinates and a chopper will arrive as fast as it can, just in case our monitor, Kelsey, is unavailable, say she was killed by a lion, or trampled by a rhino. We had some other sound advice; if you find yourself face to face with a rhino, climb a tree; if it’s a lion don’t run, you need to stand your ground and stare it down; if it’s a hyena you better not be sleeping, it'll think you’re dead and begin feeding; steer well clear of elephants and buffalo. Always shut the kitchen doors. Some volunteers left it open, a hyena got in and it trashed the place, including chewing off the fridge doors.

### Telemetry

Maruma took us out to teach us how to use the radio telemetry. For each session one of us would be in charge of the radio and aerial, which we use to search for collar signals and to pinpoint the locations of animals. Cheetah, painted dogs, lions and elephants are collared at iMfolozi.

On the radio we turn up the gain to full, turn up the volume and select a named channel to scan for; such as CM19 – a male cheetah; HIP636 – a pride of lions; Fire – a painted dog. With the radio configured we stand on the truck’s seats, hold the antenna up high and begin rotating.

Holding the antenna vertically does a long range scan, covering about 5km in each direction. We turn it around 360 and hope to hear a beeping signal. If we do, and it’s strong enough, we can switch to short range and begin checking the radio for bars of strength. A slow beep tells us the animal is resting, the faster the beep the more active they are – it’s incredibly useful to know if something is on the move.

Pinpointing the exact location is tricky; when a rough direction is known we flick the aerial between different clock points; 12pm, 6pm, 3pm, 9pm, comparing beeps and bars to work out which is loudest and clearest.

There’s some gotchas with all this. Sometimes we pickup back-signal, a strong signal in the opposite direction; sometimes the animal is a long way away but on the top of a hill, so the signal is strong, at other times we might lose the signal because the animal is close but in a deep valley. We use Kelsey’s expertise to know which is which, and she drives based on our best guesses, then we try again.

### Recording notable species

When we see cheetah, black rhino, lions, painted dogs or elephants, we note our sightings on data sheets. We record their GPS location, a description of the location, what they were doing, and any other notes; like specific animal IDs, pack names, the type of sighting (seen, signal, triangulation, info from tourist, etc), and the composition of the group (2 adult females, 1 juvenile male, etc). These paper sheets all get transcribed into an excel spreadsheet on a power-hungry Windows laptop.

### Finding our first lions

With the training under our belt (we located an unused collar at camp), we set off to find some real animals. We honed in on a signal from a pride of lions and Maruma drove in their direction. From the top of the hill we could see a gathering of vehicles below, the telemetry pointed there too; this would be an easy first find.

Sure enough, beneath the shade of an umbrella acacia tree, was a pride of lions. Two males and four females, quietly sleeping in the morning sun. But this visit was not without a little drama – two tour groups had arrived with us, and another car, which had been watching them with their air-con on and the engine off had drained their battery. In-front of the lions the tour guides were attempting to jumpstart the 4x4, without much success. The noise the tourists made alarmed the lions and they soon left. We did too, escaping the burning sun for the shade at camp.

### Waiting for Bheji’s pack

A pack of wild dogs had been denning near the roadside, and in the past few days their pack and 13 pups had been seen in the road, playing and cavorting. With a signal from the hill besides camp, we headed there hoping to see them. Each morning and evening a pack is likely to leave their den and go on a hunt; based on the signal, Kelsey knows which road to park on to see the animals emerge.

At iMfolozi you can't go off-road, so when you’ve pinpointed the signal and are as close as you can be, it’s a waiting and hoping game – hopefully they’ll cross besides us. We were close, we could hear the dogs and pups playing, their squeals and squabbles audible from the truck, but we couldn’t see anything through the thicket. We waited for hours, until the sun went down. Perhaps tomorrow.

### Vocalising lion

On the way back we stopped to scan for cheetah CM19, it had been spotted nearby. When the engine cut-off, and before the noisy buzz of the radio was turned on, we all heard it; a male lion vocalising nearby. Our attention shifted; where was this lion?

With a red lamp Kelsey scanned the tree line, looking for two reflective eyes in the dark. We drove up, and reversed down, back and forth trying to find it. One hand on the wheel, another on the torch, all eyes looking right. The vocals kicked off again, a beautiful nighttime call from this powerful beast. I made a recording, but we never saw him.

## Day 2 – Puppies, cubs and cheetah

Our first _really_ early start, waking at 4am for a 4:30am departure, a bark scorpion welcomed us on the decking. We'd be getting up this early everyday for two weeks. At 4am it’s still night, and when the skies are clear you can see orion and [the magellanic clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_Clouds). Gone are the sweltering hot winds and 30C temperatures, replaced with a cold stark breeze that cuts right through you; t-shirts and shorts replaced with thick coats, hats, gloves and jeans; sometimes blankets too.

### CM19

We started where we left off, and headed for the only male cheetah in the park, CM19 (more males will be arriving soon to improve genetic diversity). Following the signal, we headed along a management road, closed to the public, the red light out again, scanning the hills for cat eyes. A genet gives us false hope. Then we see him, sitting in the open grass, awake, he stares straight at us and his eyes glow.

In the dark he gets up and heads towards us, cautiously investigating our truck. We stay quiet, and avoid movement – the cheetah seemed agitated, but he soon calmed. He settled 10m from us and watched us, before returning to the impenetrable bush.

{% figure imfolozi-cheetah-cm19.jpg landscape %}

### Bheji’s pack

After our disappointment at not seeing the pack and pups last night we set out to find them again. An early signal told us they weren’t at the den. Did they leave early on a hunt?

There’s something about the thrill of the chase that Kelsey loves; when she’s searching for wild dogs she drives "like a savage", in her own words. Potholes and branches left in her wake, she speeds along the dirt roads as we frantically try to pinpoint the dog signals. Fire and feather, where are you? The cold morning air cuts through me, I'll bring a coat tomorrow. We stop, take a reading, and we're off again, reversing at speed, turning round, and zipping down another road. The roads are a maze, but Kelsey knows where to go. On the back seats we’re thrown about, our arms bruised from bashing the black metal bars, bums off seats as we hit a ridge, hold on tight.

"Dogs", Kelsey suddenly shouts, "photos, photos". To our right, coming out of the bush, a pack of dogs. They weren’t on a hunt, the dogs were with puppies, 13 puppies. Bhejie’s pack was moving den, and we’d found them in the act. Adult females moved ahead, checking the route for danger, others backed up the rear, while some checked the pups and pushed them along. Some puppies stopped to look or play, before being ushered on. Within seconds they were gone again, their fluffy white tails dancing as they jogged to their new home. What luck.

{% figure imfolozi-bheji-pack-on-move.jpg landscape %}

{% endfigure %}

We snapped photos of as many as we could; we'd need the shots to ID each of the dogs; who's there, who's missing. A dog that’s missing may be injured, sick or dead. Or just elsewhere.

"How lucky are we, hey?", Kelsey says, "If we’d left the Cheetah any later we'd have missed them". We wait a while to see if they re-emerge, but their signal tells us they’re resting. On a hill besides the boundary fence, we stop for coffee and rusks, a group of vervet monkeys flee in the distance.

On the drive back to camp a [duiker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duiker) bounds across in front of us, closely followed by a sprinting dog.

In the midday sun we rest. While we eat bacon sandwiches a herd of elephants passes by in the valley below, buffalo sleep on the riverbed.

{% figure imfolozi-elephants-near-camp.jpg landscape %}

{% endfigure %}

### Lion cubs

At 3pm we clamber back onto the open top truck and drive off again, this time scanning for cheetah CF13 and Alfie’s pack of dogs. In the same direction there’s a tourist report of lions and their cubs. The signals don't give us much to track, a faint long range signal perhaps, a ping from the wilderness where no car can go. We focus on the lions.

Between points 7 and 8 on the park map there’s a low bridge that crosses the river. There’s a small pool of standing water where birds feed and terrapins sit. Looking downstream we found the lions. A pride of 4 adult females, lying in the dry mud, their tails occasionally wafting away flies. Amongst them their cubs played. We tried to count them, 7 maybe? 8? Another one runs out from the long grass, 9? A tenth pops up its head from behind mum. An elephant monitor drives by, "I've never seen so many lion cubs", he says.

10 cubs were playing. About one month old, they were a joy to watch. Through binoculars we saw them leap about, play fighting, one stalked conscientiously towards its sleeping mother, and pounced on her; she jumps with a fright, a successful attempt. Others ran around frantically, pawing each other while sitting on their rear legs; wherever we looked there was a cub doing something cute.

Behind us three rogue buffalo were sleeping. We hoped the lions might see them, we hoped for a hunt. But they were upwind, and the lions seemed content to continue their slumber. Each time one might rise and walk, or show signs of activity, she’d flop back down again and close her eyes. By nightfall our eyes were heavy too.

## Day 3 – Kite, hide and lions

Each day we rotate seats in the truck, another person records data, another is unlucky enough to sit in the middle, a third takes the telemetry. Today was my turn to find the signals. Perhaps this is why it was a quiet one. We tried to find Brodie’s pack; nothing. We tried to find the female cheetahs; nothing. We drove to another hill and scanned again, nothing. Then another hill, and so on. On the roadside we found a nesting lapet-faced vulture.

At Mpafa hide we escape the vehicle to the shady confines of a wooden hide. Outside the scene looked landscaped, like some sort of zoo, but entirely natural. A beautiful tower of rocks formed a wall to the left, a small water pool beneath it, a gentle grassy slope leading down to it from the right. A perfect place to stop and watch.

With our instant coffee and UHT milk, into which we dipped rusks, we watched a white rhino grazing. A large grey-backed kite swooped in, circled, and rested on a tree alongside us; a magnificent bird. Outside I fed the tame mocking cliff chats by hand. At 10am we ate ice cream at Impila camp, and at the volunteer camp we had french toast, and then we slept, the early mornings were catching up with us.

### Let sleeping dogs lie

As per usual, we set out again in search of dogs, tonight we wanted to see Bheji’s pack, the dogs we’d spotted moving dens. Their signals were resting by their new den, in the evening light we waited for them to do something. A red helicopter flew overhead and circled around the den, section ranger Jed was onboard with researcher Christine; they messaged Kelsey, the dogs could be seen outside their den – sleeping.

From the truck Kelsey kept us entertained, "let’s play ID the poo", and she hurled a mound of dry baby rhino poo at us, Philippine ducked and I caught it, the shit shattered. She told us about a Zulu tradition, where sticks are taken from black rhino poo, sticks tainted with "black magic" (she says in a zulu accent), and placed secretly in people’s homes in an attempt to break up a relationship.

The dogs never moved, so we did.

### Nearby lions

A stroke of good fortune led us to pick up a very close signal for HIP636, we left the dogs and drove towards them. The signal was strong, they were nearby. A slender mongoose ran across the road ahead, as we kept our eyes peeled for yellow bodies in the grass. In the bare branches a southern yellow-billed hornbill sat besides us, Claire scanned again, pinpointing their location at a crossroads, we turned left.

{% figure imfolozi-diving-hornbill.jpg landscape %}

{% endfigure %}

I saw them first, two females, "1 o’clock" I shouted to Kelsey, we stopped abruptly and immediately we were silent. These two lions were right besides us, we didn't want to scare them off. The younger one was spooked, she upped from her bed and hid behind the trees, we could see a moving head eyeing us between the branches. The older female, the collared one, was nonchalant, she didn't move and she paid no attention. An incredible sight, to be so close to these powerful and majestic wild animals.

{% figure imfolozi-fearful-lion.jpg landscape %}

{% figure imfolozi-lion-at-sunset.jpg landscape %}

{% endfigure %}

This pride’s story was a sad one, they’d once left the park and attacked livestock. One was shot and killed by the community, another died from poisoned meat, others later got tuberculosis and died; there used to be a pride with cubs, now there were two; a mother and daughter, presumably. The younger lion’s nervousness around people and vehicles was justified.

Tonight we cooked spaghetti bolognese together, and Philippine serenaded us with her rendition of "Silent night" in German. I don't know why.

## Day 4 – Alfie’s pack, CF7 cheetah, bomas

A cloudy start to the day, it was dry and warm. We took our bearings from the nearby hill and headed East. A large spotted genet narrowly avoided our bumper. Alfie’s pack hadn’t been sighted in weeks, they’d been denning in the wilderness. So when we drove the 1h30 trip across the park to find them Kelsey wasn’t hopeful of seeing anything. "We have to try though. We need visuals on all the packs". We expected a quiet morning and at most a triangulation based on perpendicular signals. So when we found a dog sitting peacefully on the roadside, a long way from where we expected, we were all shocked.

"What dog is that?", Kelsey asked. "What is it doing?", "Photos, photos". Another appeared, they paced up and down the road, defecated (this bit’s important) and then crossed into the bush. Kelsey put her foot down, climbed the hill, and turned off onto a little dirt road to umbondwe viewpoint so we could head them off. "Here they come". Now there was three, the third had a collar, we ID'd him as Zoom; Alfie’s pack. They continued up and over the hill to where we couldn’t follow. "Where are the others?". They seemed too casual to be hunting, "it's like they've lost something". We continued to scan for Zoom and Madlala, the two collared dogs in the pack, and returned to where we first saw them.

{% figure imfolozi-alfies-pack.jpg landscape %}

{% figure imfolozi-wild-dog-macro.jpg landscape %}

{% endfigure %}

We didn’t need to wait long, soon more dogs appeared. Zoom returned, then two more, crossing the road and heading back to their den. Above the thicket line we spied another dog on the hill, sitting still, it looked like a guard post. The den must be in the valley. Another 3 dogs appear from nowhere and cross the road; we all scrambled to get photos. Now the signal told us the dogs were resting.

Remember the defecating bit? When a wild dog takes a shit and we can get to it, we bag it up. Researchers are using the faeces to identify the dog’s diets. Cue Philippine and Kelsey using sticks to push shit into a brown bag, "nooo, you’re letting it touch the sides". Two stinky bags of shit sat in the back of the truck for the rest of the morning. "Did one of you guys step in something?".

### Cheetah CF7

One of the collared cheetahs, CF7, hadn’t been seen in a while, and while waiting for the dogs we picked up a strong signal for her. With speed we rushed away from the dogs and scanned the horizon, our binoculars were focused on the hill, searching. “With a signal this good I don’t know why we can’t see her”. We pass a herd of zebra, warthogs munched on the grass, a [woolly necked stork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly-necked_stork) stood amongst them. A group of [blue waxbills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_waxbill) foraged in the dirt.

{% figure imfolozi-zebra-misty-morning.jpg landscape %}

{% endfigure %}

“There she is”, Kelsey spots her up on the hill, right at the top, a spotted rock that’s hardly moving. Eyes like a hawk. Through my binoculars I could just about pick her out; she sat patiently on the hillside, no signs of cubs. We use a dead [knobthorn tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegalia_nigrescens) to remember where we parked, the hooked and gnarly trunk became our signpost. She might move closer, we'll return later. (She did move, but only into the shade).

### Lions in Hluhluwe

The white WildlifeAct truck and the telemetry means tourist’s will regularly stop to ask what we're looking for, and where to find animals. One of them told us about a pride of lions over in Hluhluwe. The tarmac’d road leads us out of iMfolozi, beneath the corridor road, and into the adjacent park, Hluhluwe, where the foliage is more green but less palatable. We pass wildebeest, nyala and elephants.

We try and try to find the lions, this would be the corridor pride. Folks in a truck on the roadside have their binoculars out. Sure enough, in the distance, there’s a male lion lying down and a female hanging in an acacia tree. I didn't know lions climbed trees.

{% figure imfolozi-lioness-in-tree.jpg landscape %}

### Bomas and centenary centre

A boma is an animal enclosure. We visited the park’s bomas to see the creatures there; orphaned black and white rhino – poachers got their parents, wildebeest and buffalo sold to other parks – caught wild and brought here, white rhino waiting to be moved.

From outside these large wooden pens we get close-up views of the park’s wild animals. The white rhinos don’t like us, and threaten to charge; the buffalo are confused, the wildebeest scared. They all recognise our human form. It’s so odd that they don’t recognise or fear us when we’re on the back of an open top truck. Our form is masked, and the truck becomes a portable hide; every time we get close to a wild animal and it doesn’t freak out and run, or get angry and confront us, I’m surprised. The 4-wheeled motor vehicle is just a confusion to them.

It was feeding time for the two orphaned black rhino. They have been reared by humans and aren’t fearful. They’re fed a diet of milk and hay, and don’t mind us watching them closely. They talk to each other, making high pitched squeaks, a bewitching and endearing noise; beasts this big shouldn’t make such delicate and delightful sounds. It makes you want to cry, like a soppy Disney movie.

The centenary centre is just around the corner. The road there was filled with playful giraffe and elephant. We had our first close encounter with elephants, 4 bulls, nervously close, they walked our way. We’d heard horror stories about elephants trampling people and cars, one charged Claire’s car on a previous trip, tusking the girl next to her – a terrifying experience. "We should go now", Jannes said. But Kelsey kept her distance, and the elephants showed no signs of agitation, they crossed behind us without incident. At the centre we ate cheeseburgers and chips.

### Buffalo and wild dogs

At 4:15pm Kelsey took us out to where we saw Bheji’s pack moving den. There we waited, checking occasionally to see if their signal was moving. A rhino path intersects the road we’re on, “That’s a well used rhino path, some of these paths are 100s of years old”.

After an hour the signal starts to move, the sky above us is red and Kelsey puts her foot down. We hold on tight, she pulls away, Claire finds the signal, "2 o’clock – 3 o’clock", Kelsey drives faster. We veer off the road, taking a sharp right onto a bumpy management track, through the trees, ducking to avoid branches, skidding to a halt at the valley edge.

Down on the riverbed we spot the dogs, they’re confronting a herd of buffalo. They don’t hunt buffalo, this is play – they love to toy with them; dogs will zip between them, too agile for the buffalo, nipping at their heels. We watch one buffalo charging the, but it does so in vain, one dog doesn't even rise from its rest. The dogs eventually leave them be, and continue on their nightly hunt, moving out of sight.

Kelsey gambles and we rush around to the guard post on the opposite side of the river. No sign of the dogs. The buffalo are here, moving in the herd, a young’un in the middle. Stars begin to dot the sky, a distant nightjar sings, the buffalo shuffle by. “There’s nothing better than this, hey?”

## Day 5 – A quiet vulture day

This morning it’s cold. A mist fills the valley and the air is wet, the cold cuts through my coat, we shiver in our slumber. After seeing Alfie’s pack we wanted to check-in on them again, they’d been seen with puppies on the road. We drove across the park to find them, but when we neared the signal wasn’t there. We go higher but it now seems like the pack has returned to the wilderness.

At Mpila we have an early coffee and buy reserves. A vervet monkey hears us eating and gets too close, we fend it off and it scrams. "Those things will claw your face. You’ve got to show it who’s boss".

Today is [International Vulture Awareness day](http://www.vultureday.org/2016/index.php), to mark this all the WildlifeAct reserves were putting out carcasses and doing vulture counts. At iMfolozi there’s some game that died in transport, they’ve been put out. We arrive to find a graveyard of bones and 3 untouched carcasses, the shrivelled skin of a buffalo sits behind them. Nothing is eating them, no lions, no vultures, the meat must be bad. This isn’t a good start. The stench of rotting animal fills the air, it’s foul and we cover our noses. Keeping our distance, we sit at the roadside and watch for vultures.

Over Hluhluwe are 30 vultures spiralling in the thermals, but none head this way. We just need one to catch sight of our carcass. We wait, Feline does her sudoku, Jannes reads his book, we wait for over an hour. Finally a single white-backed vulture heads down, shortly followed by another. 10 arrive on the scene, but they don’t stay long and they don’t eat – the meat is bad. We scan for tags on their wings, or GPS packs on their backs, but we see none.

Our evening session is quiet too. We headed for Brodie’s pack and used the telemetry to locate them – they were resting just away from the road, but out of sight. We head up and down the road, scanning, but their occasional moving signals always stop, and they return to rest. No hunting tonight.

On the drive home the crescent moon smiles at us, it sits just above Jupiter.

## Day 6 – Brodie’s pack make a kill

We’re still on the trail of Brodie’s pack again this morning. We get a quick signal from the hill at camp and return to their den site. Today looks more positive, there’s some activity, a moving signal, it’s moving, they’re leaving – “10 o’clock”, we follow the road. "There, up on the hill", two dogs are waiting, but they aren’t hunting. "Where's the rest?". They disappear into the bush, in no big hurry. Another passes idly by, it’s Brodie herself, we try to see her _teats_, looking for signs of puppies.

We found wild dogs, which was more than yesterday, but it looks like we've missed the hunt – our collared dog stayed at the den. We turned our attention to cheetah; CF13 is nearby but resting somewhere we can’t see. We decided to have coffee at the Mpafa hide and then try again. A [yellow-breasted apalis](http://www.projectnoah.org/spottings/153341273) waited for us at the entrance.

Inside the hide reveals some secrets. Down near the water there are signs of a battle, a red liver glows in the morning sun, some entrails sit at the base of a tree, and there’s blood in the water. The dogs did hunt, they made a kill, and they did it all in sight of this hide, and we missed it. Kelsey looks gutted, if you’ll pardon the inappropriate pun. We drink our coffee.

"Dog", Feline shouts as I choke on my hot drink. On the ridge to the left a dog has appeared, shortly followed by four more. 5 of them, all from Brodie’s pack – Brodie and collared Munundi included, they all head down to the battle scene. They sniff at the body parts, picking and chewing, then head into the undergrowth, there’s a carcass there. It’s a male nyala, they pull it out and feed. Painted dogs eat quickly, and they eat until they’re full. Then they return to the pack and regurgitate food for the pups. Some feed frantically while others rest, play or watch guard.

Many come down to the water to drink, lying oddly on their front, chins in the water, ears flat back, quickly lapping up what they can. They pick up the organs and chew on them, two grab each side of the stomach, pulling it apart and spilling the green digested grass on the floor; one rolls around in it. Adorable.

A buffalo approaches and drinks from the water, there are terrapins too, and a Hamerkop is trying to swallow a chunk of fish. A little ringed plover skirts about besides a drinking dog.

Other cars are beginning to arrive at the hide now, a WhatsApp message has told a group what’s to be seen. We watch the pack for an hour, a breathtaking and privileged sighting, we were all mesmerised by the charismatic behaviour of these animals. We leave when the dogs leave, just as a queue of jeeps and SUVs turn up.

We speed off in search of cheetah CF13, but never find her. Ironically a car that missed the dogs tells us, “You drove straight past a cheetah and a lion”. Now it seems the cheetah is headed into the wilderness after the male lion sent it fleeing. On the way home we stop to photograph impala, they were being pestered by oxpeckers.

### Black rhino

Sunday afternoon is for writing up data sheets and doing chores. We washed down the truck before its service tomorrow, and filled in all the excel spreadsheets for our week’s sightings. At 4pm we’d finished, so headed out to find the wilderness cheetah. We stayed until dark, we scanned, and searched, but we saw nothing. Philippine had stayed at the house and I thought, "she’s missed nothing".

Of course then we stumbled on three [black rhino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-central_black_rhinoceros). A male, a female and a calf. Until now I'd wondered if I could tell the difference, the pictures show only subtle differences. It was immediately obvious, they behaved differently; the white rhino would be wary of us, but would walk away slowly, calmly, not really even noticing us; the black rhino definitely noticed us, they ran, turned and watched us from afar. It huffed; black rhinos are more likely to charge us, but they’re also inquisitive, they often come closer to inspect the vehicle and see what we are – then they charge or run away.

We stayed silent, we dared not move, we wanted them to come closer, not only to get a better look, but to also get a good look at the notches on their ears, a branding that can be used to ID them. They didn't come closer, instead opting to run away, into the darkness.

What a privilege it was to see this rare beast, only 2,000 still exist in the wild.

### Braai

At camp we made a fire from dry tree branches and Kelsey cooked us up a braai; grilled chicken, sausage, venison burgers, curried butternut squash, potatoes and a chick-pea and baked bean sauce. A scrumptious feast cooked over hot coals.

## Day 7 – A day of rest

Spending 12 hours a day on the back of a truck isn’t good for the back. A jolt jarred some muscles and I needed a break from all the driving. The Toyota truck needed a service, Kelsey and the girls headed to Hluhluwe for the day, while Jannes and I stayed home. We wrote blogs, slept, tagged photos and did admin work, while they were away.

I was sad to miss the puppies they saw on the road, Alfie’s pack had left them there while out hunting. I wasn't so sad to have missed the two angry elephants they encountered, both of which were close and threatened to charge.

## Day 8 – Camera traps

Today was a little different. At 6am we headed out to scan for cheetahs and to change the camera traps. Scattered throughout the park are cameras mounted on tree stumps, they are motion activated and save photos to an SD card. Every so often volunteers go out to them to swap out the SD cards and change the batteries. This means leaving the safety of the vehicle.

When walking in the bush you walk in single file, with the leader at the front – if anything happens, it happens to them. If we bumped a lion we'd need to stand our ground, we didn’t. Most of the cameras are close to the road, some a couple of metres, others in sight of the truck; one was a short trek, up and over some dirt hills. We were all nervous. Below us the ground was dry, the dirt crusty, beside us we saw termite mounds and warthog holes, a little porcupine burrow too.

Changing the camera is easy; unlock the case, check the number of photos taken, swap out the memory cards, swap out the batteries, reset the time and date, take a test photo, and hey presto. "Trap is clean". Sometimes things do climb up into the camera casing, nasty things like spiders and scorpions, when I opened one a gecko came scuttling out and almost gave me a heart attack. Others keep watch.

One camera trap took us out through dusty bush, our surroundings were orange and desert-like, a secretarybird strutted by – searching for snakes, a lilac breasted roller flew across, dazzling us with its colours, a bateleur flew high above us.

The trail took us to a management road which runs along the border-fence. The border prompted talk of poachers, poaching prevention techniques, supply chains, the ugliness of rhino horn poaching, corruption, convictions and shootings. It’s all devastating. The fence isn’t strong enough to stop elephants. We pass an old rhino skin, and a banded mongoose skips away from us. Back on public roads, we stop at a riverbed viewpoint and drink coffee.

### Finding cheetah CF13

When we’re done with the last trap we switch our attention to CF13. Throughout the day we'd been pinging her signal, getting a rough location. Now we were close, the camera was besides a cheetah scent-marking tree and CF13 was nearby. From up on the hill we looked down into the valley to find her, some impala looked nervous, on the opposite side was movement – our cheetah was heading toward them, and us. Her belly looked swollen, she must be pregnant.

The impala sprint away, and CF13 disappears into the valley. We try to pinpoint her but she’s moving away from us now. We change positions and get another strong signal, but frustratingly she doesn’t reappear.

It’s a similar story with Bhejie’s pack in the evening. The signal besides their den is hard to interpret, it's in a valley, their den is beneath rocks (seen in a photo taken from a heli’); it bounces a lot – holding up the antenna and keeping it still, you can hear the changing intensity of the beeps. Determining when they are actually leaving is almost impossible. Tonight we learnt this too late.

We rushed up and over the hill on okhulho loop and tried to follow their signal. Four southern ground hornbills took to the sky as we rattled by, a crowned lapwing disappears when it lands – perfect camouflage. No dogs though. We missed them.

## Day 9 – Birdwatching and elephant herds

Today it’s my turn to scan, and we’re on the road early looking for Alfie’s pack. The signal takes us across the park, over the river and up towards where we’d spotted them before. Hopefully we might see puppies again. But the short range signal from the telemetry puts them in a place hard to get to; for them they can simply cross the river and carry on, for us it's a 20 minute drive. Kelsey deliberates about which way to go, and which side of the river to put us. We head back, at speed, back over the bridge, and taking a quick right turn, down towards Nselweni lodge.

It’s a camp and everyone is sleeping, so we hush up and head to a viewpoint that overlooks the river. The signal is strong, but we can't see them. As we'd do in the truck, we wait it out. A perfect opportunity for early morning birdwatching, as well as coffee and rusks, of course. From the rickety wooden lookout point I spot birds that get me excited; trumpeter hornbills, crowned hornbills, brown-hooded kingfishers, black-collared barbets, fiscals, drongos, geese and mousebirds, and my favourite, an african paradise flycatcher.

In the rainy season the river would fill up more, and in the wet pools you’d see hippo. We don't know where they disappear to when the river is dry, as it was today. Buffalo were sleeping in the riverbed.

Every now and then we scan again to see if the dog’s signal has moved. Out of nowhere we spot one, coming over the hill, it’s sprinting into the distance – to the water for a drink. There’s another too, it does the same, and they both soon disappear. Shortly we see spooked nyala, running from something, and there’s a hyena call, but we catch no further glimpse of the pack.

### Finding ellies

The morning dog session finished early, but rather than go back we begin to scan for elephant breeding herds. We'd passed some ‘ellies’ on the road, on our way to the dogs. "Shall we scan for elephants?", Kelsey asked. Claire looked nervous, but I point the antenna, find a direction and we head for BH331.

There are signs of them, trees knocked down, a lingering smell, but at the end of the road – a camp, we see no sign of them. We scan again but give up and head back. But on the same road, we now found an elephant, a few of them were grazing by the roadside. We assume it's BH332, but when I scan again it's a different herd, BH178. On the road beside us we also see fresh lion tracks, we scan for prides but don't find any.

There are three females around us, and a youngster feeding from its mother. A female nearby looks agitated, she’s swinging her trunk, we put down the telemetry and stay quiet – forgetting about the lions, we don't want the elephant to charge us in this tight space. As a precaution we begin edging forward.

Out of nowhere the breeding herd appears, led by the largest female elephant - the collared one we'd picked up with our scans. She’s walking fast, practically running, trunk swaying, ears flapping and she's leading over 50 elephants through the forest, young and old rush by us – all rushing through, almost a stampede. We watch in awe as they all cross right behind us. As their path bottlenecks they spread out to get across.

"One is coming, Kelsey, Kelsey, Kelsey, one is coming, behind" – Philippine, alarmed by the beast heading quickly our way, out of the thicket, we pull forward and we’re clear, it can cross, it trumpets at us as it walks on by. For the remainder of our trip, "Kelsey, Kelsey, Kelsey" became a catchphrase for us, it should be Kelsey’s ringtone.

Away from the lions, in the mid-morning sunshine, we stopped by the river viewpoint. Some cars had gathered there, down in the basin we could see some white rhino, a lone elephant bull, a sleeping male lion and in the shade nearby, a collared female. These two must be mating, and they’re probably the ones that left those tracks we'd seen. The lions were too far and too sleepy to keep me interested, instead I watched the white-fronted bee-eaters.

### Cheetahs and Lions

The afternoon session was a little different, we headed out to find cheetah and lion. Philippine sat upfront because it was cold and cloudy. We split into teams; left and right; points awarded for different animals, certain animals get more, like lions – 10 points and warthogs – 3 points, a herd of impala – 1 point.

We scanned for HIP636, the youngster and the female, and found them remarkably quickly, sat just away from the road again. Kelsey’s team got a very quick lead that we could never beat, no matter how many impala we found. The lions were sleeping, we left them in search of CF13; we saw many white rhino, warthogs, and even some crested guineafowl, but no cheetah. Philippine reluctantly conceded defeat to Kelsey, they were over 40 points ahead and only a black rhino would catch us up, and we stopped to watch the sun go down – a beautiful African sunset against the umbrella acacias.

Back at camp Jannes cooked us his impressive rice and venison stew, and over dinner we listened out for nearby lion calls.

## Day 10 – A day in Hluhluwe

Kelsey needed to drive to research up in Hluhluwe to drop off some photos, dog scat and other research material we’d gathered. We left again at 4:30am and headed north through the park, stopping to scan for Alfie’s pack again on the way.

This time we went straight to Nselweni to try and spot them, but their signal had moved and we had to follow the signal. Out and around, we drove the 20 minute trip over the river, and up the hill. The signal told us they were over the distant hills; Kelsey called in on her radio and we got permission to follow them along a management track.

The path was rocky, and with each divot, hole and bump, the truck swayed left and right, bashing us against the black railings and renewing our bruises. But the views were incredible. We could see right across the park, the peaks, valleys and trees looked beautiful against the early light. We passed sleeping buffalo, an old buffalo skull and some woolly necked storks.

This is where we had our favourite rhino sighting. Two white rhino mothers were with their calves, grazing very close to each other. The calves, about the same age, not more than 2 months old, were inquisitive. They kept looking up, playfully, staring at each other. The mothers meanwhile were vying for territory and the good grass, they squared-off and there was a minor scuffle before feeding resumed. Behind their backs the two babies approached each other, they rubbed noses, like a kiss, and looked longingly at each other – a tender moment two little wonders, a brief moment of play and companionship for a creature that lives most its life in solitary. Then they parted ways. Another privileged sighting.

The dogs evaded us, their signal dimmed and they returned to their den. On the top of the hill we had coffee then continued on route to Hluhluwe.

### To Hluhluwe

From iMfoloze we passed under the corridor road and into Hluhluwe park. The tarmac’d road took us past herds of zebra, towers of giraffe and groups of wildebeest. An african hoopoe flew alongside us, hooping as we drove. We stopped to sample bushman’s tea, with its minty fragrant leaves, before continuing onwards and upwards.

Not long into Hluhluwe and the scenery has changed. Gone are the thorny thickets, the dusty sands, the round rocks and aggressive acacias; they’re replaced with verdant green forests, flowers, and even palms – in some places it almost feels tropical. Higher up, where there is more water, and where the plants are less palatable, the flora trumps the fauna.

### Cameras in leopard hotspots

Again we took a management road, and headed away from the tourist trails for a quick route to some camera traps. At a viewpoint we stopped to rest, and Kelsey tested us on our scat knowledge; little brown pellets and a track – either kudu or giraffe. There were other tracks too, wild dogs, lion, hyena; the base of the paw print has three bulges for a cat, and two for a dog. Up here there’s a hide too, Thiyeni hide, which smells profoundly of bat poo.

The two camera traps we needed to change were in a leopard hotspot. They'd been placed there to try and photograph spotted genet riding on rhinos. Leopards are the hardest things to spot; you don’t see them unless they want to be seen, they hang out in trees, run away at the sound of vehicles, and many sightings are simply a glimpse – a spotted tail disappearing into a bush. Leopards are also opportunists, their sneaky and out of nowhere can snatch a quick meal. So it was with great trepidation that we got down from our vehicle to change these traps. We all wanted to see leopard, but perhaps now was not the best time. A pack of baboons were fumbling leaves nearby, they’d provide us with an early warning sign if anything appeared. Thankfully none showed up, and we changed the two traps without incident.

### Hilltop

While Kelsey was sorting out her research things, getting some gizmos fixed and whatnot, we all hung out at the hilltop resort. There was talk of a pool, but none of us fancied it in the cold, especially when it’s half a kilometre from food. Instead we relaxed on the veranda, looking out over the hills, pretending we could see the sea, which Jannes had believed you could.

We had coffee, snacks and burgers, we bought maps of the park, and we enjoyed our free time. Two red-winged starlings tried to thief some of our grub, and two elephants walked calmly in front of the railings. They were heading to a little water hole and didn't mind us being there, that didn't stop us from checking our exits.

Before leaving we grabbed some ice creams for the journey. By now the sun was out and the temperature was climbing to 30C. The hot wind on a moving vehicle makes it particularly difficult to eat an ice cream; which led Jannes to lean out the side, desperately trying to finish it before it melted, all the while Philippine and us others laughed hysterically, as chocolate dripped across the car’s white paint.

We didn’t get home until 2pm so there was no evening session. We played "30 seconds", and tried to guess clues about south africans we’d never heard of. Claire cooked us all a delicious spaghetti bolognese.

## Day 11 – Bumping lions

Kelsey needed to leave on Sunday to do exams, she would be covered by Christina, a Canadian PhD student studying the Cheetah in iMfolozi. She'd need to tag along with us a few times first. This was her first day on our truck and we headed out to find Brodie’s pack.

The session was a frustrating one. We couldn’t determine the patch the pack were hunting in, a nearby hill caused the signal to bounce, and the way the road wrapped around their den area made it hard to get visuals in the valley. We tried and tried, but saw none, despite tourist reports of a dog crossing the road near mpafa hide. When we gave up with the dogs we tried for CF13, she too didn't play ball, despite Christina’s unrelenting enthusiasm. We checked the western perimeter for her signal, following a boundary management fence trying to spot her, but she didn’t show up and the signal didn’t grow stronger.

We’d driven a long way, and we hadn’t seen much, save a fence that couldn’t stop an elephant. I was just thinking about how this session had been difficult, when we bumped two lions. By the road, lying beneath a shady bush were a male and female. They were a couple who'd been spotted mating elsewhere, and they were probably still in the throes of passion. The female was from HIP636, a pride we'd spotted twice before, her daughter, normally alongside her, couldn’t be seen.

Lions mate every 15 minutes for three days. That sounds exhausting. We knew that if we waited long enough we might see the lions get together. This male was a lazy one, and after half an hour there had been no movement, save a gaping yawn, a cursory look between the two and a flapping tail. But he did eventually stand up, and we saw the wonders of creating new life, to put it politely. Feline video’d it and posted to Facebook, her parents asked her not to share lion porn. It lasted only a minute or so, and the lions grimaced, before a climax, which sees the male perform a "[flehmen response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flehmen_response)" toward the female, checking if she’s on _heat_. We waited a further 15 minutes to see the encore before leaving them in peace.

Back at camp Christina helped me spot birds; black-backed puffback, brubru, southern masked weaver and an african paradise flycatcher.

### Bhejie’s pack

At 4pm we set out to find wild dogs, trying for Bhejie’s pack and their inscrutable den signals. Before starting, we dropped by the lions to see if they’d moved. They were still there, sleeping, and presumably copulating every now and then.

On a hillside we parked and waited for Bhejie’s pack to wake up and go for their evening hunt. We hung around for an hour, shooting the breeze, or completing sudoku. We checked signal occasionally to see if they’d moved. Then without warning they showed up; a single dog emerged from the bush, approached the road and defecated there; another came out to smell it, we’d need to pick it up and bag it later.

Then I had my favourite wild dog encounter, it was almost personal. One of the dogs simply walked up to the truck, on the driver’s side. If Christina had put her arm out the window she could have stroked it. The dog looked me in the eye, and then carried on, unconcerned. We were so close to it.

Soon the rest of the pack were here, 9 in total. This silent gathering of dogs felt like a roll call before rolling out to hunt, it was very kind of them to come over to us, say hello and then carry on with their business. They returned from where they’d come, presumably to hunt. We turned around and tried to follow them up and over the hill, predicting where their path would lead them, but they didn’t re-materialise. We wait again while the sun goes down, trying to get signal, but give up and return to the lions.

The light faded fast, but we could see the lions resting nearby; male and female. I also caught a glimpse of the younger female, she was standing up, staring at something in the distance. Suddenly a dog call, an alarm, "the dogs are here", Kelsey said, and they’d bumped the lions. The young lion must have been watching them, and in the dim light I saw her give chase; the speed and power of her sprint, the transformation from a slumbering lazy cat was staggering, it made my nerves tingle. I was nervous for the dogs too. We reversed and turned quickly, trying to follow the chase, scanning at the same time for fire and feather, checking signals. We heard a roar, and a few more dog calls, but had no visuals. The moment quietened, and we paused, finally we picked up signals again; the dogs were back at the den, we wouldn’t know if any had been injured.

That night we cooked up our second braai; Jannes was in charge of the fire, and his cunning fire-making skills almost created the biggest fire the braai pit had ever had. Thankfully it didn't catch the tree above, and the food it cooked was mighty tasty.
