> "This is Zululand, not Disneyland"

For 8 weeks, following my [4 weeks volunteering in Seychelles](/2016/08/north-island-seychelles/), I travelled to South Africa to join WildlifeAct’s “[Endangered Species Conservation](http://wildlifeact.com/volunteer/south-africa/endangered-species-conservation/)” projects. Every two weeks I'd be on a different game reserve, the first of these was [Hluhluwe–Imfolozi Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hluhluwe%E2%80%93Imfolozi_Park) (HIP). _Hluhluwe_ is pronounced roughly as " shu-shlu-way", with a bit of a slur.

WildlifeAct volunteer groups are a maximum of 5 people; me, a young German guy – Jannes, a kiwi who’s been travelling around southern Africa – Claire, a Parisienne that hates Paris – Philippine, and a Dutch girl – Feline. We’d ride together on the back of the WildlifeAct truck, live together, and cook for each other. Our monitor was Kelsey – a lively and outspoken South African from the cape. We also met "Zulu warrior" Marumo, who picked us up, took us shopping and showed us the ropes before leaving for [Somkhanda](http://africaninsight.co.za/somkhanda-game-reserve/).

Each of the reserves are in the East of South Africa, in the [KwaZulu-Natal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal) region, to the north it borders Mozambique, in the South it borders Swaziland and Lesotho. Part of it used to be the [Zulu empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_Kingdom). Zulu is a spoken language here, and many traditional beliefs, practices and superstitions are maintained.

## Entering iMfolozi

On Monday, from Richard’s Bay airport where many volunteers had just arrived, and from Fish Eagle Inn – a small hotel with lots of dogs that I'd stopped overnight at, the 5 of us, plus WildlifeAct rep’ Tarryn, drove North in an Igula Tours van. We  past the paper and timber farms, up to iMfolozi.

We met Marumo and the pristine white WildlifeAct truck at Phumula Lodge, and before heading to camp we needed to buy our week’s food. At Pick n’ Pay we filled a trolley with potatoes, apples, rice, oranges, bananas, venison, cereal and so on, oh and some last minute beer, that turned out to be non-alcoholic. Buying enough food for 6, for a week, and not knowing what each other likes, was our first challenge.

The drive from Phumula Lodge to the camp was a further 1h30, from the corridor road we turned off and entered through Nyalazi gate. It was 6pm, the sunset was a dazzling red, and on the horizon Jupiter and Venus could be seen above the distant hills. It wasn’t long before we got our first wildlife sightings. By the gate we saw our first white rhino, with calf, then another, and another, then elephants. Marumo drove quickly, from the tarmac roads to the dirt ones, and onwards, the wind blew through us, and the evening turned chilly, she slowed for impala and rabbits in the road; a hyena crossed in front of us. We arrived, I hopped out and opened the gate.

## WildlifeAct volunteer camp

Our camp is basic but it has everything we need, well, most of the time.

There's a room for guys, a room for gals a spare room and the monitor’s room. Between them is our kitchen, with a gas stove, two sinks, some shelves, and a couple of fridges and freezers. Outside there are two showers; lockable rooms surrounded in corrugated iron each with a hose pipe tied to the roof – it works. There’s two toilets, but only one was working.

There’s some outdoor but shaded decking, which protects us from sun, falling leaves and other falling nasties. On green plastic garden furniture we ate our dinners outside.

Power comes from a generator between certain hours, outside of that we can use solar, or a battery charged from solar. Some appliances don't work on solar, like kettles and toasters. Sometimes the generator doesn’t kick-on, and most of the time we leave camp before it’s due to, that means getting dressed in the dark, and using torches to check everywhere for snakes and scorpions.

The area is in drought, which means there isn’t much, if any, water. When we arrived the water stopped. Rather than clear liquid flowing from the taps, we had a muddy thick substance that looked like hot chocolate, it clogged up the hot water, the toilets and the showers. But we coped fine; we filled containers from jojo bins that had collected rainwater, we showered from buckets, we flushed _occasionally_.
