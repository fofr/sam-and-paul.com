> "This is Zululand, not Disneyland"

For 8 weeks, following my [4 weeks volunteering in Seychelles](/2016/08/north-island-seychelles/), I travelled to South Africa to join WildlifeAct’s “[Endangered Species Conservation](http://wildlifeact.com/volunteer/south-africa/endangered-species-conservation/)” projects. Every two weeks I'd be on a different game reserve, the first of these was [Hluhluwe–Imfolozi Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hluhluwe%E2%80%93Imfolozi_Park) (HIP). _Hluhluwe_ is pronounced roughly as " shu-shlu-way", with a bit of a slur.

WildlifeAct volunteer groups are a maximum of 5 people; me, a young German guy – Jannes, a kiwi who’s been travelling around southern Africa – Claire, a Parisienne that hates Paris – Philippine, and a Dutch girl – Feline. We’d ride together on the back of the WildlifeAct truck, live together, and cook for each other. Our monitor was Kelsey – a lively and outspoken South African from the cape. We also met "Zulu warrior" Marumo, who picked us up, took us shopping and showed us the ropes before leaving for [Somkhanda](http://africaninsight.co.za/somkhanda-game-reserve/).

Each of the reserves are in the East of South Africa, in the [KwaZulu-Natal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal) region, to the north it borders Mozambique, in the South it borders Swaziland and Lesotho. Part of it used to be the [Zulu empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_Kingdom). Zulu is a spoken language here, and many traditional beliefs, practices and superstitions are maintained.

## Entering iMfolozi

On Monday, from Richard’s Bay airport where many volunteers had just arrived, and from Fish Eagle Inn – a small hotel with lots of dogs that I'd stopped overnight at, the 5 of us, plus WildlifeAct rep’ Tarryn, drove North in an Igula Tours van. We  past the paper and timber farms, up to iMfolozi.

We met Marumo and the pristine white WildlifeAct truck at Phumula Lodge, and before heading to camp we needed to buy our week’s food. At Pick n’ Pay we filled a trolley with potatoes, apples, rice, oranges, bananas, venison, cereal and so on, oh and some last minute beer, that turned out to be non-alcoholic. Buying enough food for 6, for a week, and not knowing what each other likes, was our first challenge.

The drive from Phumula Lodge to the camp was a further 1h30, from the corridor road we turned off and entered through Nyalazi gate. It was 6pm, the sunset was a dazzling red, and on the horizon Jupiter and Venus could be seen above the distant hills. It wasn’t long before we got our first wildlife sightings. By the gate we saw our first white rhino, with calf, then another, and another, then elephants. Marumo drove quickly, from the tarmac roads to the dirt ones, and onwards, the wind blew through us, and the evening turned chilly, she slowed for impala and rabbits in the road; a hyena crossed in front of us. We arrived, I hopped out and opened the gate. Home for the next two weeks.

## WildlifeAct volunteer camp

Our camp is basic but it has everything we need, well, most of the time.

There's a room for guys, a room for gals a spare room and the monitor’s room. Between them is our kitchen, with a gas stove, two sinks, some shelves, and a couple of fridges and freezers. Outside there are two showers; lockable rooms surrounded in corrugated iron each with a hose pipe tied to the roof – it works. There’s two toilets, but only one works. There’s some outdoor decking, it’s shaded and it’s where we sit on green plastic garden furniture to eat our dinners.

Power comes from a generator between certain hours, outside those we can use solar, or a battery charged from solar. Some appliances don't work on solar, like kettles and toasters. Sometimes the generator doesn’t kick-on, and most of the time we leave camp before it’s due to. Often the solar battery is drained and there’s no power, which means getting dressed in the dark and using torches to check for snakes and scorpions.

The region is experiencing a drought, there’s not much, if any, water. When we arrived the water stopped. Rather than clear liquid flowing from the taps, we had a muddy thick substance that looked like hot chocolate, it clogged up the hot water, the toilets and the showers, each needed fixing. But we coped fine; we filled containers from _jojo_ bins that had collected rainwater, we showered from buckets, we flushed _occasionally_.

## Day 1 – Telemetry and lions

It’s the beginning of spring, which brings with it cold early mornings and scorching hot afternoons. Our stonewalled rooms have no ceiling fans or air conditioning. After my first sweaty night beneath a mosquito net, and after seeing the morning light poke through the glass doors, I got up at 7am and we began our day of training. 7am would turn out to be a lie-in.

The views from camp are astounding. Beyond the wire fence and trees lies a lookout point. From a precarious rock we can see out across the dry Black Umfolozi riverbed, the view stretches from the river, past the trees and out to the distant hills beyond. "You can come down here during the day, but never at night", Kelsey warns us. Dangerous creatures have been known to come up here. The rock resembles one from a movie, all we needed was a baboon to hold up a baby lion and some music playing "Circle of life".

We were shown a WildlifeAct video introduction, we had a project intro by monitor Kelsey, and were told about the emergency procedures. There’s a volunteer phone which can be used to call emergency 24hour support – we can give them GPS co-ordinates and a chopper will arrive as fast as it can, just in case our monitor, Kelsey, is unavailable, say she was killed by a lion, or trampled by a rhino. We had some other sound advice; if you find yourself face to face with a rhino, climb a tree; if it’s a lion don’t run, you need to stand your ground and stare it down; if it’s a hyena you better not be sleeping, it'll think you’re dead and begin feeding; steer well clear of elephants and buffalo. Always shut the kitchen doors. Some volunteers left it open, a hyena got in and it trashed the place, including chewing off the fridge doors.

### Telemetry

Maruma took us out to teach us how to use the radio telemetry. For each session one of us would be in charge of the radio and aerial, which we use to search for collar signals and to pinpoint the locations of animals. Cheetah, painted dogs, lions and elephants are collared at iMfolozi.

On the radio we turn up the gain to full, turn up the volume and select a named channel to scan for; such as CM19 – a male cheetah; HIP636 – a pride of lions; Fire – a painted dog. With the radio configured we stand on the truck’s seats, hold the antenna up high and begin rotating.

Holding the antenna vertically does a long range scan, covering about 5km in each direction. We turn it around 360 and hope to hear a beeping signal. If we do, and it’s strong enough, we can switch to short range and begin checking the radio for bars of strength. A slow beep tells us the animal is resting, the faster the beep the more active they are – it’s incredibly useful to know if something is on the move.

Pinpointing the exact location is tricky; when a rough direction is known we flick the aerial between different clock points; 12pm, 6pm, 3pm, 9pm, comparing beeps and bars to work out which is loudest and clearest.

There’s some gotchas with all this. Sometimes we pickup back-signal, a strong signal in the opposite direction; sometimes the animal is a long way away but on the top of a hill, so the signal is strong, at other times we might lose the signal because the animal is close but in a deep valley. We use Kelsey’s expertise to know which is which, and she drives based on our best guesses, then we try again.

### Recording notable species

When we see cheetah, black rhino, lions, painted dogs or elephants, we note our sightings on data sheets. We record their GPS location, a description of the location, what they were doing, and any other notes; like specific animal IDs, pack names, the type of sighting (seen, signal, triangulation, info from tourist, etc), and the composition of the group (2 adult females, 1 juvenile male, etc). These paper sheets all get transcribed into an excel spreadsheet on a power-hungry Windows laptop.

### Finding our first lions

With the training under our belt (we located an unused collar at camp), we set off to find some real animals. We honed in on a signal from a pride of lions and Maruma drove in their direction. From the top of the hill we could see a gathering of vehicles below, the telemetry pointed there too; this would be an easy first find.

Sure enough, beneath the shade of an umbrella acacia tree, was a pride of lions. Two males and four females, quietly sleeping in the morning sun. But this visit was not without a little drama – two tour groups had arrived with us, and another car, which had been watching them with their air-con on and the engine off had drained their battery. In-front of the lions the tour guides were attempting to jumpstart the 4x4, without much success. The noise the tourists made alarmed the lions and they soon left. We did too, escaping the burning sun for the shade at camp.

### Waiting for Bheji’s pack

A pack of wild dogs had been denning near the roadside, and in the past few days their pack and 13 pups had been seen in the road, playing and cavorting. With a signal from the hill besides camp, we headed there hoping to see them. Each morning and evening a pack is likely to leave their den and go on a hunt; based on the signal, Kelsey knows which road to park on to see the animals emerge.

At iMfolozi you can't go off-road, so when you’ve pinpointed the signal and are as close as you can be, it’s a waiting and hoping game – hopefully they’ll cross besides us. We were close, we could hear the dogs and pups playing, their squeals and squabbles audible from the truck, but we couldn’t see anything through the thicket. We waited for hours, until the sun went down. Perhaps tomorrow.

### Vocalising lion

On the way back we stopped to scan for cheetah CM19, it had been spotted nearby. When the engine cut-off, and before the noisy buzz of the radio was turned on, we all heard it; a male lion vocalising nearby. Our attention shifted; where was this lion?

With a red lamp Kelsey scanned the tree line, looking for two reflective eyes in the dark. Up and down the road we drove and reversed, one hand on the wheel, another on the torch, all eyes looking right. The vocals kicked off again, a beautiful nighttime call from this powerful beast. I made a recording, but we never saw him.

## Day 2 – Puppies, cubs and cheetah

Our first early start. Getting up at 4am for a 4:30am departure, a bark scorpion sat on the decking. We'd be getting up this early everyday for two weeks. At 4am it’s still night, and when the skies are clear you can see orion and [the magellanic clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_Clouds). Gone are the sweltering hot winds and 30C temperatures, replaced with a cold stark breeze that cuts right through you; t-shirts and shorts replaced with thick coats, hats, gloves and jeans; sometimes blankets too.

### CM19

We started where we left off, and headed for the only male cheetah in the park, CM19 (more males will be arriving soon to improve genetic diversity). Following the signal, we headed along a management road, closed to the public, the red light out again, scanning the hills for cat eyes. A genet gives us false hope. Then we see him, sitting in the open grass, awake, he stares straight at us and his eyes glow.

In the dark he gets up and heads towards us, cautiously investigating the truck. We stay quiet, and avoid movement – the cheetah seemed agitated, but he soon calmed. He sat down 10m from us and watched, before returning to the bush.

### Bheji’s pack

After our disappointment at not seeing the pack and pups last night we set out to find them again. An early signal told us they weren’t at the den. Did they leave early on a hunt?

There’s something about the thrill of the chase that Kelsey loves; when she’s searching for wild dogs she drives "like a savage", in her own words. Potholes and branches left in her wake, she speeds along the dirt roads as we frantically try to pinpoint the dog signals. Fire and feather, where are you? The cold morning air cuts through me, I'll bring a coat tomorrow. We stop, take a reading, and we're off again, reversing at speed, turning round, and zipping down another road. The roads are a maze, but Kelsey knows where to go. On the back seats we’re thrown about, our arms bruised from bashing the black metal bars, bums off seats as we hit a ridge, hold on tight.

"Dogs", Kelsey suddenly shouts, "photos, photos". To our right, coming out of the bush, a pack of dogs. They weren’t on a hunt, the dogs were with puppies, 13 puppies. The pack was moving den, and we’d found them in the act. Adult females moved ahead, checking the route for danger, others backed up the rear, while some checked the pups and pushed them along. Some puppies stopped to look, and then carried on. Within seconds they were disappearing again, their fluffy white tails dancing as they jog to their new home. What luck.

We snapped photos of as many as we could; we'd need the shots to ID each of the dogs; who's there, who's missing. A dog that’s missing may be injured, sick or dead. Or just elsewhere.

"How lucky are we, hey?", Kelsey says, "If we’d left the Cheetah any later we'd have missed them". We wait a while to see if they re-emerge, but their signal tells us they’re resting. On a hill besides the boundary fence, we stop for coffee and rusks, a group of vervet monkeys flee in the distance.

On the drive back to camp a [duiker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duiker) bounds across in front of us, closely followed by a sprinting dog.

In the midday sun we rest. While we eat bacon sandwiches a herd of elephants passes by in the valley below, buffalo sleep on the riverbed.

### Lion cubs

At 3pm we clamber back onto the open top truck and drive off again, this time scanning for cheetah CF13 and Alfie’s pack of dogs. In the same direction there’s a tourist report of lions and their cubs. The signals don't give us much to track, a faint long range signal perhaps, emerging from the wilderness where no car can go. We focus on the lions.

Between points 7 and 8 on the park map there’s a low bridge that crosses the river. There’s a small pool of standing water where birds feed and terrapins sit. Looking downstream we found the lions. A pride of 4 adult females, lying in the dry mud, their tails occasionally wafting away flies. Amongst them their cubs played. We tried to count them, 7 maybe? 8? Another one runs out from the long grass, 9? A tenth pops up its head from behind mum. An elephant monitor drives by, "I've never seen so many lion cubs", he says.

10 cubs were playing. About one month old, they were a joy to watch. Through binoculars we saw them leap about, play fighting, one stalked conscientiously towards its sleeping mother, and pounced on her; she jumps with a fright, a successful attempt. Others ran around frantically, pawing each other while sitting on their rear legs; wherever we looked there was a cub doing something cute.

Behind us three rogue buffalo were sleeping. We hoped the lions might see them, we hoped for a hunt. But they were upwind, and the lions seemed content to continue their slumber. Each time one might rise and walk, or show signs of activity, she’d flop back down again and close her eyes. By nightfall our eyes were heavy too.

## Day 3 – Kite, hide and lions

Each day we rotate seats in the truck, another person records data, another is unlucky enough to sit in the middle, a third takes the telemetry. Today was my turn to find the signals. Perhaps this is why it was a quiet one. We tried to find Brodie’s pack; nothing. We tried to find the female cheetahs; nothing. We drove to another hill and scanned again, nothing. Then another hill, and so on. On the roadside, a nesting lapet-faced vulture.

At Mpafa hide we escape the vehicle to the shady confines of a wooden hide. Outside the scene looked landscaped, like some sort of zoo, but entirely natural. A beautiful tower of rocks formed a wall to the left, a small water pool beneath it, a gentle grassy slope leading down to it from the right. A perfect place to stop and watch.

With our instant coffee and UHT milk, into which we dipped rusks, we watched a white rhino grazing. A large grey-backed kite swooped in, circled, and rested on a tree alongside us; a magnificent bird. Outside I fed the tame mocking cliff chats by hand. At 10am we ate ice cream at Impila camp, and at the volunteer camp we had french toast, and then we slept, the early mornings were catching up wit hus.

### Let sleeping dogs lie

As per usual, we set out again in search of dogs, tonight we wanted to see Bheji’s pack, the dogs we’d spotted moving dens. Their signals were resting by their new den, in the evening light we waited for them to do something. A red helicopter flew overhead and circled around the den, section ranger Jed was onboard with researcher Christine; they messaged Kelsey, the dogs could be seen outside their den – sleeping.

From the truck Kelsey kept us entertained, "let’s play ID the poo", and she hurled a mound of dry baby rhino poo at us, Philippine ducked and I caught it, the shit shattered. She told us about a Zulu tradition, where sticks are taken from black rhino poo, sticks tainted with "black magic", and placed secretly in people’s homes in an attempt to break up a relationship.

The dogs never moved, so we did.

### Nearby lions

A stroke of good fortune led us to pick up a signal for HIP636, we left the dogs and drove towards it. The signal was strong, they were nearby. A slender mongoose ran across the road ahead, as we kept our eyes peeled for yellow bodies in the grass.

I saw them first, two females, "1 o’clock" I shouted to Kelsey, we stopped abruptly and immediately we were silent. These two lions were right besides us, we didn't want to scare them off. The younger one was spooked, she upped from her bed and hid behind the trees, we could see a moving head eyeing us between the branches suspiciously. The older female, the collared one, was nonchalant, she didn't move and she paid no attention. An incredible sight, to be so close to these powerful and majestic wild animals.

This pride’s story was a sad one, they’d once left the park and attacked livestock. One was shot and killed by the community, another died from poisoned meat, others later got tuberculosis and died; there used to be a pride with cubs, now there were two; a mother and daughter, presumably. The younger lion’s nervousness around people and vehicles was justified.

Tonight we cooked spaghetti bolognese together, and Philippine serenaded us with her rendition of "Silent night" in German. I don't know why.

## Day 4 – Alfie’s pack, CF7 cheetah, bomas

A cloudy start to the day, it was dry and warm. We took our bearings from the nearby hill and headed East. A large spotted genet narrowly avoided our bumper. Alfie’s pack hadn’t been sighted in weeks, they’d be denning in the wilderness. So when we drove the 1h30 trip across the park to find them Kelsey wasn’t hopeful of seeing anything. "We have to try though. We need visuals on all the packs". We expected a quiet morning and at most a triangulation based on perpendicular signals. So when we found a dog sitting peacefully on the roadside, a long way from where we expected, we were all shocked.

"What dog is that?", Kelsey asked. "What is it doing?", "Photos, photos". Another appeared, they paced up and down the road, defecated (this bit’s important) and then crossed into the bush. Kelsey put her foot down, climbed the hill, and turned off onto a little dirt road to a viewpoint so we could head them off. "Here they come". Now there was three, the third had a collar, we ID'd him as Zoom; Alfie’s pack. They continued up and over the hill to where we couldn’t follow. "Where are the others?". They seemed to casual to be hunting, "it's like they've lost something". We continue to scan for Zoom and Madlala, the two collared dogs in the pack, and return to where we first saw them.

We didn’t need to wait long until more dogs appeared. Zoom returned, then two more, crossing the road and heading back to their den. Above the thicket line we spy another dog on the hill, sitting still, it looks like a guard post. The den must be in the valley. Another 3 dogs appear from nowhere and cross the road; we all scramble to get photos. The signal tells us the dogs are now resting.

Remember the defecating bit? When a wild dog takes a shit and we can get to it, we bag it up. Researchers are using the faeces to identify the dog’s diets. Cue Philippine and Kelsey using sticks to push shit into a brown bag, "nooo, you’re letting it touch the sides". Two stinky bags of shit sat in the back of the truck for the rest of the morning. "Did one of you guys step in something?".

### Cheetah CF7

One of the collared cheetahs, CF7, hadn’t been seen in a while, and while waiting for the dogs we picked up a strong signal for her. With speed we rush away from the dogs and scanned the horizon, our binoculars focusing on the hill, searching. “With a signal this good I don’t know why we can’t see her”. We pass a herd of zebra, warthogs munched on the grass, a [woolly necked stork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly-necked_stork) stood amongst them. A group of [blue waxbills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_waxbill) foraged in the dirt.

“There she is”, Kelsey spots her up on the hill, right at the top, a spotted rock that’s hardly moving. Eyes like a hawk. Through my binoculars I could just about pick her out; she sat patiently on the hillside, no signs of cubs. We use a dead [knobthorn tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegalia_nigrescens) to remember where we parked, the hooked and gnarly trunk became our signpost. She might move closer, we'll return later. (She did move, but only into the shade).

### Lions in Hluhluwe

The white WildlifeAct truck and the telemetry means tourist’s will regularly stop to ask what we're looking for, and where to find animals. One of them told us about a pride of lions over in Hluhluwe. The tarmac’d road leads us out of iMfolozi, beneath the corridor road, and into the adjacent park, Hluhluwe, where the foliage is more green but less palatable. We pass wildebeest, nyala and elephants.

We try and try to find the lions, this would be the corridor pride. We see another truck stopped on the roadside, they’ve got their binoculars out. Sure enough, in the distance, there’s a male lion lying down and a female hanging in an acacia tree.

### Bomas and centenary centre

A boma is an animal enclosure. We visited the park’s bomas to see the creatures there; orphaned black and white rhino – poachers got their parents, wildebeest and buffalo sold to other parks – caught wild and brought here, white rhino waiting to be moved.

From outside the large wooden pens we get close-up views of the wild animals we’ve been seeing in the park. The white rhinos don’t like us, and threaten to charge; the buffalo are confused, the wildebeest scared. They all recognise our human form. It’s so odd that they don’t recognise or fear us when we’re on the back of an open top truck. Our form is masked, and the truck becomes a portable hide; every time we get close to a wild animal and it doesn’t freak out and run, or get angry and confront us, I’m surprised. The 4-wheeled motor vehicle is just a confusion to them.

It was feeding time for the two orphaned black rhino. They have been reared by humans and aren’t fearful. They’re fed a milky drink and hay, and don’t mind us watching them closely. They talk to each other, making high pitched squeaks, a bewitching and endearing noise; beasts this big shouldn’t make such delicate and delightful sounds. It makes you want to cry, like a soppy Disney movie.

The centenary centre is just around the corner. The road there was filled with giraffe and elephant. We had our first close encounter with elephants, 4 bulls, nervously close, they walked our way. We’d heard horror stories about elephants trampling people and cars, one charged Claire’s car on a previous trip, tusking the girl next to her – a terrifying experience. "We should go now", Jannes said. But Kelsey kept her distance, and the elephants showed no signs of agitation, they crossed behind us without incident. At the centre we ate cheeseburgers and chips.

### Buffalo and wild dogs

At 4:15pm Kelsey took us out to where we saw Bheji’s pack moving den. There we wait, checking occasionally to see if their signal is moving. A rhino path intersects the road we’re on, “That’s a well used rhino path, some of these paths are 100s of years old”.

After an hour the signal starts to move, the sky above us is red and Kelsey puts her foot down. We hold on tight, she pulls away, Claire finds the signal, "2 o’clock", "3 o’clock", Kelsey drives. We veer off the road, taking a sharp right onto a bumpy management track, through the trees, ducking to avoid branches, skidding to a halt at the valley edge.

Down on the riverbed we spot the dogs, they’re confronting a herd of buffalo. They don’t hunt them, but they enjoy toying with them; dogs will zip between them, too agile for the buffalo, nipping at their heels. We watch one charge them without much hope, one dog doesn't even rise from its rest. The dogs leave them be, and continue on their nightly hunt, moving out of sight.

Kelsey gambles and we rush around to the guard post on the opposite side of the river. No sign of the dogs. The buffalo are here, moving in the herd, a young’un in the middle. Stars begin to dot the sky, the buffalo quietly walk by. “There’s nothing better than this, hey?”
