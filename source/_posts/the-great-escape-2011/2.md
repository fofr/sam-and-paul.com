## Marina Gasolina and REBEKA

Friday started with all four of us downstairs at Komedia, its dark wooden floor and low ceilings a stark contrast to the carpeted Queens Hotel. Oh So Quiet opened our proceedings, and we were dutifully impressed. The General played next, but they were trying too hard, and we left for “The Hope” venue to see a hung over Marina Gasolina play her entertaining female punk act, with its so very punk “I’m so hungover I’ve forgotten the words” moments. Great fun mind. We weren’t sure where to go next, but our well thumbed band guide told us about REBEKA, “polish electro acoustic lo-fi disco with Chinese techno and dirty synths”. Sold! Out to Horatio’s on the peer we headed, via the free chocolate stick stands. Out over the sea, REBEKA performed their phenomenal mix of beats and vocals, they were loving it, we were loving it, it was fabulous. Shame they didn’t have an album out, I’d have bought it instantly.

## Dan Parsons

At the vietnamese place, Pho, for lunch, where we didn’t try the weasel shit coffee, we mixed our beers with noodles and spring rolls. And out again for the evening session, starting with Dan Parsons and his strand of Australian indie pop at Komedia studio. The Firestarter album made you want to dance, and the girls in front were loving it, so much so Dan rather unsubtly told us all where he was staying… .

## Dean McPhee, Josh T. Pearson, Villagers

Onwards to the Uncut venue. Dean McPhee took the stage first, I already own his fabulous Brown Bear 12”, I bought it instantly after hearing the phenomenal Sky Burial track. A one man act, he showed us how astounding his guitar skills were, it gave me shivers, and I am eagerly anticipating his first album. Incredible haunting and complex sounds produced from a single guitar. We all sat to watch Trevor Moss and Hanna Lou, a quaint country act that grew on us as the set continued, really very pleasant. The guy we’d come to see though was Josh T. Pearson, a bearded giant, his soft grasping folk and guitar work stole the show, as did his between track jokes and wry humour, “what’s the difference between a musician and a large pizza? A large pizza can feed a family,” he joked, wearily. Despite being full, the venue was hushed and in awe, his presence all encompassing. “How good was that!?”, Mark exclaimed. The headliners were Villagers with their Frodo like lead singer. We all knew “Becoming a Jackal”, and soon day two of the festival was over. With some 1am chips we stumbled home.
