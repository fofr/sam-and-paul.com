## Day 1 – No rest for the conservationist

From the onset we realised that Mkhuze was an intensely worked conversation project. Shortly after arriving at camp, suitcase barely down from the truck, we were back out again – our first session with PJ. All of us had come from other projects, all of us knew how to scan, we knew the drill; we could dispense with the tutorials and get straight down to business.

Every session begins with a trip to the beacon. It’s a concrete tower surrounded by wooden steps. On the top is a radio mast; its height makes it the best place to scan from – we can get rough bearings for all the collared animals from here. Lapwings hang out near the bottom, occasionally seen with their cute little ground-faring chicks. Clear skies above us, on a warm evening, we made a start; WD2 long south, WD6 short south, lions at and near the boma.

Much like in Tembe we needed to do a boma check. The boma has three male lions, they arrived from the Kalahari and are being introduced to improve the gene pool. For any animal introduction they must first spend a few weeks in the boma; to acclimatise, for one thing, Mkhuze is a very different climate. The signal for one of Mkhuze’s lion prides, MLF5, was near to the boma – perhaps they’d been interacting with the new males.

We took the old yellow Toyota, it’s a workhorse, around the boma; checking the electrics, checking for problems, checking for lion tracks on the outside. The internal electrics were shorting but we couldn’t fix them. With the boma looking reasonable, a more sturdy affair than Tembe’s, we left in search of cheetah MCM17 and MCM18, and then the wild dogs, one of two packs here, WD6. Both cheetah and dogs were unreachable, the latter were somewhere near the pan.

On-route to the pan we stopped for 4 waterbucks to cross. A remarkable sight in Mkhuze, “I’ve never seen them here”, PJ told us. With only 40 in the park, that was 10% of the population.

Mkhuze, like the other parks in KZN, is in the midst of severe drought, and the pan is almost dry. A pod of hippo were crammed into the wet bits, their grunts audible from the road. We scanned again for the wild dogs but they were out of reach, somewhere in the pan, amidst the reeds. As the light dimmed, a herd moved to the water’s edge; buffalo, over 40 strong. Another remarkable sight, PJ hadn’t seen them for a couple of months, they grunted too. In our logs we noted the waterbuck and buffalo, taking GPS points for each, and then the dogs, a “C” entry – a triangulation, two data points with bearings, their intersection giving an approximate locale. Here in Mkhuze it’s all about the triangulations, this was the first of many.

To top off a remarkable beginning, we found two snakes crossing the road. In the dark we couldn’t easily identify or photograph them. The first quickly climbed a tree and disappeared out of sight – a black snake with no clear markings, it’d be unwise to follow; the second stayed in the road, for a short while it hid beneath the truck – this one was green, also without discernible patterns to ID it. A good start.
