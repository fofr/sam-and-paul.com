## Day 1 – No rest for the conservationist

From the onset we realised that Mkhuze was an intensely worked conversation project. Shortly after arriving at camp, suitcase barely down from the truck, we were back out again – our first session with PJ. All of us had come from other projects, all of us knew how to scan, we knew the drill; we could dispense with the tutorials and get straight down to business.

Every session begins with a trip to the beacon. It’s a concrete tower surrounded by wooden steps. On the top is a radio mast; its height makes it the best place to scan from – we can get rough bearings for all the collared animals from here. Lapwings hang out near the bottom, occasionally seen with their cute little ground-faring chicks. Clear skies above us, on a warm evening, we made a start; WD2 long south, WD6 short south, lions at and near the boma.

Much like in Tembe we needed to do a boma check. The boma has three male lions, they arrived from the Kalahari and are being introduced to improve the gene pool. For any animal introduction they must first spend a few weeks in the boma; to acclimatise, for one thing, Mkhuze is a very different climate. The signal for one of Mkhuze’s lion prides, MLF5, was near to the boma – perhaps they’d been interacting with the new males.

We took the old yellow Toyota, it’s a workhorse, around the boma; checking the electrics, checking for problems, checking for lion tracks on the outside. The internal electrics were shorting but we couldn’t fix them. With the boma looking reasonable, a more sturdy affair than Tembe’s, we left in search of cheetah MCM17 and MCM18, and then the wild dogs, one of two packs here, WD6. Both cheetah and dogs were unreachable, the latter were somewhere near the pan.

On-route to the pan we stopped for 4 waterbucks to cross. A remarkable sight in Mkhuze, “I’ve never seen them here”, PJ told us. With only 40 in the park, that was 10% of the population.

Mkhuze, like the other parks in KZN, is in the midst of severe drought, and the pan is almost dry. A pod of hippo were crammed into the wet bits, their grunts audible from the road. We scanned again for the wild dogs but they were out of reach, somewhere in the pan, amidst the reeds. As the light dimmed, a herd moved to the water’s edge; buffalo, over 40 strong. Another remarkable sight, PJ hadn’t seen them for a couple of months, they grunted too. In our logs we noted the waterbuck and buffalo, taking GPS points for each, and then the dogs, a “C” entry – a triangulation, two data points with bearings, their intersection giving an approximate locale. Here in Mkhuze it’s all about the triangulations, this was the first of many.

To top off a remarkable beginning, we found two snakes crossing the road. In the dark we couldn’t easily identify or photograph them. The first quickly climbed a tree and disappeared out of sight – a black snake with no clear markings, it’d be unwise to follow; the second stayed in the road, for a short while it hid beneath the truck – this one was green, also without discernible patterns to ID it. A good start.

## Day 2 - A team is born

### First morning

We’d have one more session as a contingent of 3. The regular start time would be 4:30am, and this first morning was a pleasant one – clear skies, not too chilly, a slight wind, the crescent moon setting on the horizon.

From the beacon we get bearings for the lions, MLF4 and MLF5 are still near the boma. In the dark, stars still twinkling, we find them, so close to the road that the bucky’s headlamps illuminate their eyes. This pride consists of 3 adult females, a sub-adult male and a juvenile, for which there remains some debate about the mother. MLF4 had a large belly, she was pregnant, the result of an incestuous relationship with her recently deceased son. The lions relaxed, and the dawn chorus began, flappet larks clapped their wings besides us. When the sky brightened the lions left, disapearing into the hills.

(Much like last night, cheetah MCM17 (Mkhuze-cheetah-male 17) and MCM18 were nearby, but their triangulation from the tar road indicated they were too far to be seen.)

WD2 is the larger of Mkhuze’s two wild dog packs. It’s 12 strong with rumours of denning and the possibility of puppies. However they traditionally stay in the south of the reserve, and given current circumstances getting there is difficult. A long term roadworks project is underway, and the main road south is blocked by ongoing bridge works. But right now their signal is northernly, perhaps we might get visuals.

I’m scanning, and we rush onwards, wherever the signal takes us. Out to the Eastern hills, down a rarely used management track, rocking from side to side, up and over bumpy dirt ramps. Giraffes trot away, and wildebeest run by. We keep driving until the signal reaches 9 o’clock. Now it’s a waiting game, they could hunt this way, we could see them. Sunbirds, flycatchers and drongos flit about the trees while we wait. The strong signal, 7 bars, maximum, begins to fade; they’re going the wrong way, the signal stops and they’re gone. PJ is disappointed, he knew this was an opportunity missed.

This morning’s session is cut short, we need to meet our new volunteer, Kelly, at camp. On the tar road home we spot a feeding elephant bull and a hoopoe flies into and out of a nest – calling to its mate, “hoo-poe, hoo-poe”. A zebra stands by itself, it eyes us as we rattle past. In the road a hinge-back tortoise, making a brave crossing, it’s camouflage failing against the black tar.

Kelly arrived after a stopover at ZRR, coming from the Panthera project at Eastern Shores (lots of camera traps studying leopards). We would eventually be 5; Brendan (or at this point, “Brandon”) would join us at the end of the week. Cue the Wildlife Act introduction video by Jo, and PJ’s presentation about Mkhuze.

### Snaring

Mkhuze has a big snaring problem – over 2,000 are found a year. Poachers, many who are members of the surrounding communities, but not all, enter the park and leave metal snares to illegally catch bush meat. These wire cables hang between trees and create a slipknot that tightens as it’s pulled; game walk through, get caught and pull to free themselves – over days, weeks or months these wires tighten, cutting into their skin, then deeper still, creating deep wounds that disable the animal, or choke it. It’s a horrible and cruel way to die – one lion had a snare cut right through its stomach. Many of the poachers that set these traps do so for sustenance; they are communities with a history of “living off the land”, and “to a desperate man there’s no such thing as betrayal”. But others are known to create illegal butcheries, and as usual, it’s not so black-and-white.

Priority species such as lion, cheetah and wild dog get caught in these snares. Just the week before we arrived, when my friend Philippine was volunteering here – a snare killed one of the wild dogs – its collar kicked out a mortality signal, but it was too late, it was dead when PJ got there. The pack reduced from 4 to 3, Philippine scrubbed the collar clean and the dog was buried. Utterly devastating.

Poachers use everything they catch; an incidental cheetah kill will lead to the illegal sale of a cheetah hide; animal parts have value. On the magnetic map in the kitchen PJ highlights all the places dogs, cheetah and lion have been killed; snaring hotspots. Each death comes with a life story; many include orphaned cubs or abandoned pups.

### Fixing boma electrics

The electrics in the lion boma were still shorting; a metal cable from the feeding slide keeps catching the perimeter lines. Our plan; cover it in a plastic sheath. For half an hour we sawed through a black pipe, prepping it for the job; then PJ fed it through the fence, onto the cable, getting electrocuted in the process, but it appeared to work.

The lions watched from afar, curious about this black thing being prodded into their temporary home. Within a few minutes they were chewing it, and as we watched they pulled it off, a wasted effort. PJ stood with arms on hips, we couldn’t help but laugh; hilariously annoying.

For the rest of the session we tried to find WD6. As we sped in their direction an African Green Pigeon flew over, a giraffe stood and stared so intensely that it didn’t notice us, we searched for its focus but saw nothing. Wildebeest ran alongside us. The dogs were moving in the south again, nearby, but the road works thwarted us again. No visuals tonight, we settled for a triangulation.

### Cheetah brothers

On the way back we find ourselves behind the two male cheetah we’ve been tracking, MCM17 and MCM18. They’re using the tar road. In the dark they walk alongside us, before cutting in front, not seeming to mind our truck’s headlamps. In the light they walk together, stopping to sniff, stretch and scratch on a tree, then crossing and lying besides us in the dark. This is the first time I’d seen a cheetah that wasn’t alone; it was fascinating to observe the interaction of these two brothers.

### Team Africa is born

We all pitched in to cook dinner. Whether it was luck or fate, “team effort!” was misheard as “Team Africa!”, and that night, in the grubby confines of a volunteer kitchen, a wildlife monitoring task force was born. Like Captain Planet, but not really.

## Day 3 - To collar a cheetah

The hot weather didn’t last long, and this morning it was overcast with drizzle. We were prepared with coats, wet weathers and plastic bags for our backpacks. In the misty rain we climbed the beacon and got our morning bearings, hyenas called in the distance; another trip to find WD2. But it was the same story; from the same place we wait, they travel in the wrong direction and we don’t see them. WD6 are out of reach too, their triangulation put them in the south, our route still blocked by road works.

It’s a slow morning. While we’re sat beside the road a millipede walks by, in Afrikaans slang it’s a “shongololo”, PJ says. “A shongoloola?”, “No, a shongolla”, “I think it was shongoloolala”, “Deuce bigalow, male shalongolo”, “Would you like some sholongoloa with that”? “What’s that noise? – It’s a shunalinga”. Cue Team Africa’s first in-joke. Slow morning indeed.

While the dogs were a no show, I focused on the birds; a juvenile bateleur, a crested barbet – like a bird that can’t use makeup, a group of speckled mousebirds. The guide book describes a bird call as “puka puka”, and we all do our best to work how that would sound. (“sweet sweet sweet-potato”)

### To dart and collar a cheetah

PJ gets a radio; there’s an uncollared cheetah with a kill on the road side. It’s amazing how quickly a slow session can turn into the best yet. We arrive to find a recently killed and otherwise untouched female impala, a female cheetah is resting nearby – recovering from the hunt, she hasn’t yet started feeding; from her markings we ID her as MCF13 – not seen since July. We sit and watch patiently. Tourist cars begin to arrive, and a truck carrying roadworkers stops to look too – its big engine “swoosh” scaring the cat when it kicks in to leave.

She eventually gets up to eat – first checking all around her; compared to the wild dogs she’s polite and clean. She eats delicately and neatly, starting on the leg, licking and chewing. By now the dogs would be finished, entrails torn everywhere. After the leg, she picks up the impala by the neck and repositions, to begin feeding elsewhere.

Over the radio PJ gets a request; the vet wants to collar the cheetah – we have a spare collar at camp and the reserve has no collared females. We rush back, pick up the vet with his drugs and dart rifle, and the small orange collar, before zipping back to the cheetah. Kelly and I frantically try to turn on the collar as we drive – you rub a magnet on the collar’s chamber, which triggers it on and off, supposedly – eventually the radio begins to beep at the right frequency. It’s on. In the back our vet measures out the drugs and preps the dart, Joris holds the rifle steady.

When we return the cheetah is sleeping. We ask some cars to make space and we edge in towards the cat, driving slowly into the bush. We need to be within 25m for the dart to work. Closer, steady. The vet in the passenger seat, holds the rifle steady, takes aim and fires. Direct hit, the pink dart goes into the cheetah’s leg and she runs away, startled. Start the stopwatch; she should be asleep in 10 minutes.

That was the longest 10 minutes. We’re super excited now, the dart went in, it was a good shot, and we’ll soon be collaring her; everything was going to plan, this was going to be awesome. Or so we thought. The vet goes in search of her, she’s lying down and PJ heads over the the collar and towel, to cover her eyes. But she stands up, she’s not asleep. Come 20 minutes and the cheetah still shows no signs of sleeping, she’s walking around, a pink dart hanging from her rear. Maybe the dart didn’t go off? Sometimes they don’t inject correctly.

Take two. A second dart is prepped, and we begin the process again. This time the cat is edgy, so we drive up extra slowly, the vet standing beside me, resting on the bucky’s wooden platform for the best shot. He takes aim and fires, but misses, the dart drops short – deploying its cargo of drugs into the dirt on impact. The cheetah bolts, disappearing into the thicket. Curses. “She’ll be back”, he says, half-heartedly. Our excitement is gone, replaced with disappointment and frustration.

Hopes dashed, we leave, and the tourists do too – she’s gone.

#### Try, try again

We had plans for the afternoon session, but before starting anything we returned to the impala carcass to see if our cheetah had returned. The row of cars told us she had. Her belly was swollen with food and she was resting. Tourists quizzed us about the pink dart in her leg. PJ radio’s the vet, he’s on his way, we’re trying again.

Now, the following events were simply infuriating. The vet arrives, and pulls back to prepare the dart and drugs. Meanwhile the clock ticks over to 4:30pm, tourists are lining one side of the road, and on the other there’s space for vehicles to pass. It’s home time now, all the road workers are clocking off, heading back. The first big truck arrives, people fill the back, understandably they stop to watch the cheetah too. But everyone is trying to get home, behind them another truck, then a tractor, and another tractor, and so on. There’s a traffic jam, and the drivers are impatient – they begin to honk their horns, and rev their engines, they begin to shout, some even get down off the truck and walk along the road – meanwhile all the tourists try to point out the cheetah and beckon them to hush up. The cheetah watches, unfazed. More and more people come.

Soon the dart is ready, and the truck is told to leave. A convoy of machinery swiftly follows. The vet drives into position. But the frustration doesn’t end. Just as the road clears a tourist pulls up alongside us – “what are you looking at?” she asks, “A cheetah”. She looks in the tree. Then she drives around and parks herself alongside the vet, blocking the road. Not all the workers have left yet, and now a tractor arrives, blocked by the 4x4 it tries to squeeze by; its trailer collides with the truck, they reverse, then collide with a tree. PJ has his head in his hands. What a mess. Cheetah still calm, enjoying the show perhaps.

Eventually the road is clear, the vets are ready. But the tourist is taking pictures with a flash, the white light unnerves the cat. Undeterred the vet continues, he lines up a shot and fires, a direct hit, another great shot. The tourist is shocked, she wasn’t expecting that. The cheetah runs, and we wait again. Surely it must work this time. The heavens open, the rain pours, it arrives like mist, and the visibility drops. Thanks weather.

After 10 minutes PJ, some field rangers and the vet head out on foot to find her, collar and towel in hand again. We scan for the lions again, they’re nearer now, great – that would be bad. We sit in silence, there’s a radio call, it’s PJ. “I have a visual of a very mobile cat”. Curses. Now our cheetah was running around with two darts in her rear, poor thing. Our fear was that she would fall asleep somewhere out of sight, near the lions. It would be disastrous. Later we learn that the drug used was bad, it wouldn’t have worked; we could sleep soundly knowing the cheetah wasn’t at risk.

### Too much excitement for one day

Not done yet, we set out in the closing darkness to pursue the dogs, heading along the tar road, following the signal. PJ stops suddenly; we look on the floor, expecting a rabbit, or a running impala. In front is an elephant, a male bull, it’s heading our way. We stop and wait, but it keeps walking. He’s not charging, his ears aren’t flat-back, but he’s definitely interested in us.

This bull has priors, PJ has encountered him before. PJ previously reversed and pulled off the road to let the elephant pass, but it followed and kept coming towards him, which left him in a difficult spot. This time around PJ stood his ground.

The elephant got closer, on the back we were all nervous. It gets right up close, it’s trunk almost on the bumper. PJ begins to rev the engine, he bashes on the door, and shouts “woah boy”. The elephant comes around the side to our left, squeezing between us and a tree, its awkward, the elephant doesn’t have anywhere to go. PJ repositions, reversing, turning, staying face to face with the elephant, we’re not backing down, he’s not backing down. PJ revs again, bashes his door, keeps shouting “woah boy”. Our adrenaline is pumping, hearts pounding, Joris shifts to his right, this could turn bad. I’ve never been so afraid. One more rev. The elephant rises up, but he turns and runs, he’s gone, running into the darkness. We breathe a sigh of relief.

What a day.

## Day 4 - Building bridges, going places

Ever heard of a red roman? What about a solifuge? Or a camel spider? They go by several names. Anyway, one of these giant ugly creatures was running around our room this morning. Mildly terrifying.

We had clear skies and a crisp wind for our early start. Signals from the beacon told us that WD2 had returned south, we’d missed our opportunity to see them – we had a new imperative to go south; we made a plan. WD6 were south too, which made it a quiet morning in the north; we focused on camera traps that were setup at cheetah scent marking trees, swapping out batteries and SD cards.

Brendan wasn’t with us yet, so the spare seat on the truck was given to “Brandon the scorpion”, a poor dead scorpion we found beside a camera trap. We fashioned him a seat belt from the strands of thread fraying from the seats, and he came with us wherever we went. Our luck changed.

Road works were shifting, the bridge south wasn’t completed yet, but work had begun on a second bridge – blocking access to a management track we needed, one which would have taken us the very long way south. All routes were blocked, the concrete platform was being prepped for work starting Monday – it had been scraped down and was impassable. Work wouldn’t begin for 4 days. The signal for WD6 was just beyond this first bridge. Cue “Team Africa’s” first bridge building exercise.

We heaved great rocks onto the concrete, a foundation for our ramp. Smaller rocks were padded around the edges to firm them up, then dirt piled on top to create a stable ramp for the bucky. It worked, the Toyota could safely pass, only _slightly_ bashing its tailgate on the way through. The road south was open!

From the south we scanned for the first time, the dogs were nearby. We scanned for Ezweni and Madikwe 2, 2 o’clock, take the short road towards the shooting range. Here they were, all three dogs in WD6 pack, walking along the road towards us. Typically they walked right by us, down the road and over the bridge we’d just built. Thank you dogs. In the distance an elephant pushed over a tree with a loud crack, we followed the dogs.

They crossed through the hills and we took the high road, trying to stay ahead of them. We lost visual, but kept following the beeps and bars on our receiver. Then to our right, the pack, running at top speed, chasing impala. My first sighting of the dogs going flat out, a sight to behold, breaking the speed limit on our dirt track. They disappeared again, before dashing out in front of us, across the road, the impala still evading capture. Like a scene from an action movie. The impala got away and we found the dogs resting on the roadside.

Dark now, we left them be and called it a night. Bats (not butterflies) flitted above us, occasionally a little too close.

## Day 5 - Servals, dogs and vultures

Pack WD2 hadn’t been seen for a week, we needed to get visuals; check their health, check for snares; the ramps were ready, the path set. We began our mighty trip south at 3:30am under clear skies, the last vestiges of the milky way lighting our way, a slithery crescent moon setting on the horizon, we drove towards the southern cross.

From the ramp we took the management track, the beginning of the “long way south”. It’s a slow and bumpy road which eventually stops at a dead end. Tree branches are low, acacia spikes risk catching you in the face, “heads” shouted every few seconds, head lamps lighting up the route, truck swinging left, then right, we grab on tight.

### When is a serval not a serval?

“Stop! Serval!”, PJ didn’t see it. A yellow spotted cat like creature climbing a tree besides us. We reversed. “Where?” It had gone. “You saw a serval?”, PJ exclaims, both in disbelief and frustration that he’d missed it. “Are you sure?”, Kelly begins taking the GPS point for the sighting, we flick through the mammal book looking for what we’d seen. “Oh, it was a genet, a large spotted genet” – “We get those at camp”, PJ replies, already shifting the truck into gear and driving away. Team Africa has its mascot; a genet cum serval, proudly serving, wildlife servailance, et al. From now on everything is a serval.

### Finding all the dogs

At the road’s dead end I stand on the truck, darkness still surrounding us, scanning for a signal. WD6 pack has three collars; Dumela the alpha male – his stopped working, Thandezile (Zile to her friends), the 8 year old alpha female (a legendary dog), and Fezo, her daughter. I scanned for Zile and Fezo, trying desperately to get any kind of signal, a vague beep comes through the static. Then a howling angry grunt from the darkness, we don’t stick around to find out what it is. You wouldn’t want to bump a black rhino or an elephant in this tight space. And the elephants were down here somewhere.

We go off road. From the track PJ carves his way through gaps in the thicket, driving around thorny trees, following old game trails, threading a way through in the dark, until we reach another management track. A crossing made, it brings us out on the far side of the pan, a green and luscious place, the air smelling of fragrant potato bush. Zebra, wildebeest and nyala graze in the early morning mists.

The road takes us to the fence line where we cross over into Phinda, taking their border road to Mkhuze’s southern gate. We stop to scan, and from the top of the truck I’m treated to a spectacular view; the morning sun is just about to come up, there’s mist in the valleys, and the hilltops resemble an oil painting; a stork flies past, perfecting my mind’s picture. All this while scanning for Zile.

Inside Mkhuze, besides the hunting lodge, we get a strong signal, Zile at 9 o’clock, we zoom into the hills, it’s imperative we get a visual. I scan as we drive, tweaking gain, watching bars, rotating the antenna, arms aching. 7 bars, maximum, she’s in front, no behind, we’ve past her, reverse, turn, try again, 7 bars. There, in front, an impala runs, chased by a single dog. They’re all here somewhere. I scan again for Fezo and Zile, or “Filo”, the pastry dogs, as I keep miscalling them. Now they’re on the road; 1, 2, 3, 4 – we snap photos for ID. This pack is 12 strong, still 8 to find. They disappear, they move away from us, the beep slows down, they’re resting.

Not satisfied, PJ brings us down the hill and out towards the dam. We’ll find them all. From a snaking management trail we go off road again, weaving through green fever trees, narrowing down the signal. A single dog sees us and runs, a scout? A guard? Are we near a den site? The signal is resting again.

Time for coffee? We unpack the cooler box and prep the cups, but the dogs catch us off-guard, they re-appear and we need to move again, driving back towards the main road, scanning as we go; all this without caffeine. We stop on the gravel path, the main road stretching out in front of us. Did we lose them? We sit and wait, perhaps it’s time to go?

#### Puppies!

Out of nowhere, to our right, a dog appears, shortly followed by another and another. Then puppies. The entire pack begins to emerge onto the road in front, 3 adults, 4 adults, 2 puppies, 4 puppies … they begin to trot up the road, yet the pack keeps coming, more and more puppies, cute little creatures bouncing with the adults, following them, playing, running into each other, 6, 7, now 10 puppies, even more, 14 puppies, stretched out across the road, their fluffy white tails bouncing as they run. The remaining adults following up from behind, the whole contingent, all 12 adults and 14 puppies! The most phenomenal sighting. 26 healthy wild dogs. PJ has an ear to ear grin.

Naming them is like trying to name the dwarves; there’s Zile, Dumela, and Fezo and Fanakalo, then Gert, Gatiep, Gompie (with his floppy ear), Genis, Gagina, Getruida, Gloudina and Griet. Each year they’re named with the next letter; all the _G_’s are yearlings. Any surviving puppies will have names beginning with H, the puppies are 4 months old, they look healthy, but there’s still a long way to adulthood in the bush.

We follow the dogs up the road, not getting too close, they turn into the bush and we follow along the nearest track. We find them resting by a waterhole; adults drinking, puppies playing, a panorama would have captured this magical scene perfectly. All the pups are nervous of us, they run away, then come back, run away and back again, so cute. Eventually the pack moves off, we lose sight once more.

It’s time to go, we need to scan for lions and retrieve camera traps. We wait for a resting signal to make one last triangulation, a breather to take in what we’ve seen. And the dogs had one last surprise for us. While sitting quietly we hear a rustle in the bushes, movement, a male nyala sprints across in front of our parked truck, shortly followed by two chasing dogs. These dogs are really spoiling us.

Our spirits were dampened slightly when we discovered lions MLF2 and MLF3, two particularly vicious females, were nearby.  We triangulated their position and asked them politely not to go towards the dogs. After grabbing the SD cards from the camera traps it was time to head back north, with speed.

### Tagging vultures

Chris Kelly, co-founder and director of Wildlife Act, monitor of monitors Cole, and volunteer Brendan, were up north working to ring and tag vultures. We needed to get north quickly if we wanted to observe. Back along the border fence, past the pan, through the off-road thicket, along the management track, over the temporary ramps we’d built; PJ drove quickly and perfectly to get us back in time. We meet Cole on the road and follow him to the next vulture nest site.

Each year, for one week, there’s an initiative to ring and tag vulture chicks. Nests near the road are marked, and using a GoPro with the longest selfie stick you’ll ever see, they are checked for suitable chicks. To be tagged they must be old enough and big enough, if they’re large enough they might also be fitted with a solar panelled GPS tracker. If the chicks are suitable a cherry-picker is brought in alongside the nest, the chick is retrieved and brought down – its bill, head, wing, tarsis, vent and cloaca are measured, blood is taken from its leg, a yellow triangular tag is attached to the top of each wing and a ring to a leg.

“Don’t shake my hand, I’m covered in vulture vomit”, Cole greets us when we get out. The chick has one defence mechanism – if a predator approaches it will vomit over 1kg of stomach contents over it; consider the food the vultures eat – decaying dead meat, along with the bacteria living inside a vulture, and you’ll understand why that’s a potent weapon; if any of that gets in your mouth you’ll end up in ICU for a few days. Brendan says hey, he’s been travelling with Cole and Chris all week, working on vulture conservation after raising funds back home.

By now it was midday, the sun was hot and there was little shade. After 10 hours on the truck, and without any coffee, this last bit was tiring, but entirely worth it. We watched as PJ and Cole rode the cherry-picker up to the nest and retrieved a 6 week old white-backed vulture chick, covering its eyes to keep it calm. From the picker they brought it to a desk with scales and tools for the job, where the experts waited – serious and focussed (before they’d been saving feathers and writing GPS co-ords on them). While the experts worked I had the delicate job of holding down the vulture’s head; arching my hand over its neck, lightly, avoiding pinching. This vulture chick is M047. And when all was done, Charlotte nervously carried the chick back to the picker, so delicate, so anxious; so happy afterwards. In total they tagged 3 vultures, there were other nests but some weren’t accessible, others were empty or the chicks were too young.

### Cheetah at night

Now, even after this marathon session, the work in Mkhuze does not end. We were out again at 4pm, searching for MCM17 and MCM18. By now it was overcast, there might even be storms. The stormy skies played havoc with our tools, we struggled to get signal from the beacon, or the quarry; we took a turn up the mountainside, a wrong turn, they weren’t here.

It was Kelly’s turn on the telemetry in these difficult conditions, but she found a signal and pointed us in a new direction. “Lots of petrol for this”, PJ warns, but it was worth it. We follow a new road, new even to PJ, which brought us past green foliage and luscious vegetation, a drainage line, out to the reserve’s edge. Kelly scans again, and there they were, our two male cheetah sitting beneath a tree.

They’re sleeping, stomachs swollen after a recent feed. We need to stay near to them for 20 minutes for the collar data to download to our relay device. They don’t make this easy; rising from their slumber they walk around, roll around, scent mark a tree, take a shit, a real show. We stay as long as we can, until it’s dark.

On the drive home lightning illuminates the sky.

We ate chakalaka and beans with rice.

## Day 6 - When shit hits the wheel

On a warm overcast morning we left in search of WD6, our first session with new Team Africa member, Brendan. Goodbye scorpion Brandon, wherever he’d gone. Joris guided us with his telemetry skills. The signal brought us into an area of impenetrable thicket, the dogs were here somewhere, somewhere in this block, but finding them was like spotting a gorgeous bush-shrike, nigh impossible in this stuff. Even when you know they’re there.

It was while zipping up and down these little roads that I noticed something sticky in my hair. I went to brush my hair with my hand and found a thick brown substance on my fingers, I raised it to my nose, expecting mud, I gagged. What is this _shit_? Vulture shit? I looked all around me for other signs of splatter. “I think a bird shat on me”, Brendan tells me that’s good luck. With anti-bacterial wet wipes I clean my hair, Charlotte too had some on her cheek. We cleaned and cleaned, but each time we stopped the smell was still with us. Where is this shit? We checked everywhere, our clothes, our hair, our bags. I looked out over the edge of the pickup, there it was, a splatter of brown shit streaking up from the wheel, across the door panel towards us. PJ must have driven through this fresh shit, it caught the wheel and was flung at us with gusto. Hitting the fan, as it were. Based on the smell and the proximity of dogs, we also ID’d the shit as being wild dog shit; the stinkiest grossest shit imaginable. What elite club I am in, how many people can say they’ve had the shit of a critically endangered wild dog in their hair, eh? “There’s no good luck if it’s wild dog shit”.

As if they could smell us, the dogs appeared. Ezweni and the two Madikwe males; Ezweni leading the way, the boma-fied males taking her lead. These two males, formerly three until a horrible snare death, are from Madikwe, and while they were being moved lived for a long time in a boma, where they were fed. They lost some of their _street_ skills, and weren’t so good in the bush after that. It’s lucky they have Ezweni to lookout for them, she dispersed from WD6 and bonded with the new group, creating this pack. Looking closely we can see recent wounds on the males from sparring with a hyena, puncture wounds, Ezweni knows not to mess with a hyena. Equally, when feeding, the males will go straight in to eat, while the experienced female know to keep a lookout. She’s schooling them. One of them rolls around in a fresh rhino midden; perhaps my experience with shit could have helped me bond with them too.

On the road back we follow hippo tracks, from some muddy patch out to the pan. And beside the beacon we stop to download lion collar data. Nearby 11 white-backed vultures fly over, they’ve been eating the bait put out for them, part of a “vulture restaurant” conservation strategy – bait them, get as many in as you can, then look for tags, etc. Though when the bait was put out yesterday none arrived.

### Yellow shapes on the horizon

We hadn’t spotted the lions in a while, we wanted to get new visuals. Our signals had told us that MLF4 had left MLF5, perhaps she was denning and the cubs had arrived. We triangulate her signal to some impossible to reach hillside and strain with our binoculars to see her. I pick out a yellow blur beneath a tree, in my photos it’s clearly moved, I’ll conclude that it was MLF4, but PJ thought otherwise, “rocks”.  These debates were the highlight of our dark and gloomy afternoon session.

## Day 7 - Getting to know the puppies

With Brendan in tow, we embarked on another epic session down south; leaving under mixed skies at 3:30am, from the beacon we headed to the ramps we’d built, onwards along the management track, off-road through the bush, around the pan, to the border road, into Phinda, and back in besides the hunting lodge. No serval this morning. We were searching for WD2, I sat up front.

The elephants have satellite collars, every night the breeding herds clock in their location. We knew they were down south, we found fresh dung, freshly ripped down trees, branches blocking our roads. We didn’t fancy bumping them in a tight space; with caution we followed our signal down a narrow side road.

It wasn’t long before our first dog sighting, a male nyala leaped across the road, a single dog chasing it. The dogs are here, they’re all in this area. Along the road, more elephant signs. We reached a dead end, we scanned again and turned back. “Oh, I see puppies”, PJ says.

### Playful puppies

Easy as that, the ball of 14 fluffy puppies was in the road, an adult supervising while the others were out hunting. We count them and follow them. They hadn’t seen vehicles much, each time the engine turned on or off they’d all jump with fear, then settle down again; PJ did it a couple of times and they soon ignored us. Now we could drive a little closer, we needed to sex them if we could, but that was impossible.

We stayed with the puppies for almost an hour; the most incredible sighting. We marvelled as they rolled around playing, bundled up into a ball to sleep, ran and fought over sticks and elephant dung, sniffed the air for scent, and stood on their hind legs to wrestle each other. They’d often break into small little groups and walk up and down the road, some would come close with confidence then run away scared. A little runt stared at us inquisitively.

### Feeding time

All of a sudden some commotion. The puppies were twittering with joy, leaping all over each other; the adults were back, they were bringing food. The adult dogs gorge themselves on their prey, return to the pups and disgorge for them; mother Zile was back and the pups go crazy, their cute little faces all covered in nyala blood, pulling apart the meat, feeding in a frenzy, as all wild dogs do. The adults run in, the pups swarm them, Gompie dives in, his floppy ear bouncing, touching noses with an overly excited pup, like a playful proud uncle. The feeding continues for a while, puppies quieten down, then another adult brings more grub and the cycle repeats.

They all stop to bask in the sunshine for a bit, white puppy tails wagging, then disappear into the thicket, their twittering noises still audible. Circling kites and a tawny eagle tell us where the kill is.

We head back; successfully avoiding elephants, scanning for lions, and stopping at a volunteer house in Phinda for coffee, rusks and fabulous views.

### All dogs in one day

This afternoon session was our last chance to go south, workers would begin tearing up our bridge tomorrow, we needed to remove our makeshift ramps. One more time we crossed the river, under sunshine and clear skies, looking for the three dogs in WD6. Brendan scanned, “Dogs” someone shouts – always my favourite part of any session; and we quickly had visuals of Esweni and the two Madikwe males. They kept coming and going, running large circles around us, in the evening sun we waited and watched before they eventually disappeared to hunt. At the bridge we shovelled away all signs of our ramp; ready to go home Joris spots a running herd of impala; we’d stumbled on the dogs again, it’s good to know where each pack is resting the night, we followed them for as long as we could, until they disappeared through thorny shrubs and the day was over.

## Day 8 - One session before St Lucia

When staying at Mkhuze, ZRR or Somkhanda, there‘s an option to spend two nights in St Lucia, a sort of break from all the wildlife monitoring. There you can do whale watching, a hippo tour, horse riding on the beach – and you can eat at restaurants. After 5 weeks straight, no breaks, I needed a rest; my old iMfolozi group were going to St Lucia too, it’d be a reunion, a reunion with pizza, sushi, beer and wine. This was my last session before my _weekend_. If my old group weren’t going, I’d have probably taken the break when at ZRR instead.

Today’s focus was cheetah and lions. From the tar road we tried to locate MCM17 and MCM18. Kelly’s scanning, she’s standing on the wooden board fixed to the roof of the bucky. “Is that impala?”, Joris spots something on the hill. “No, that’s the lions, Kelly, sit down”, PJ says. And as easy as that, the pride of lions walk our way, and cross in front of us – MLF5 with 3 younger sub adults. No sign of MLF4, probably still denning. Another sighting in the dark, too dark for good photos.

Now we head for the cheetah, we take a right and drive up a hill, and here they are, MCM17 and MCM18 basking in the morning sunshine. A striped kingfisher sits nearby.

By 6:30am we’d found all our targets; what next? We scanned and triangulated the dogs, did some camera trap work and tried to find the lions again, still finishing the session a little early.

## 2 nights in St Lucia

In St Lucia I met up with Philippine, Feline and Jannes again, the old iMfolozi posse. We were joined too by Melanie, from New York state. We were staying at Monzis Safari’s tented lodge, in backpacker accommodation – a permanent tent, a nightlight and a comfortable bed; its pitched on the roof above the shower block. I was bunking with Jannes again, just like old times.

There are two pools, a pool table, two kitchens and not much else; we didn’t use the pools, it was too cold during our stay, and we would have liked a bar; but maybe buying our own beers turned out cheaper, eh? For lunch we satisfied our biggest cravings, at Reef & Dune we ate pizza and drunk milkshakes. My first pizza in 5 weeks. So good.  We played some pool to while away the evening, though it was more _teaching_ pool than playing pool, ahem. I turned in an early night, not hungry while the others went for sushi.

St Lucia offers lots of activities; like whale watching, bird watching, boat tours, horse riding, snorkelling and so on. These options are greatly reduced when its windy, and when it rains. We cancelled plans to see whales and swim and we all joined Philippine on her trip to the beach, to go horse riding in the rain – her event was still going ahead.

After a tasty breakfast at [kauai](http://www.kauai.co.za/), we left for the beach. It takes about half an hour to walk there. We passed hippo warning signs – it’s dangerous to walk at night here, hippos come out from the lake and wander the empty streets – if they see you they’ll charge you and you’ll need to climb a tree.

The beach I was expecting was a tourist one; one with a few shops, a promenade, maybe a coffee shop. This isn’t the case – it’s a beach in a reserve, it’s pristine, save for all the garbage that gets washed up. The only buildings are toilets. This means there’s no shelter from the rain, and nowhere to grab coffee.

Philippine’s horse was a little skinny,  but it was better than the horse with one eye. We watched her ride into the distance, then we meandered up and down the beach, watching the crashing waves, the swirling storm clouds above and the scuttling crabs; we’d only need to wait an hour, the clouds passed and the sun came out.

At Braza we had lunch; souvlaki and cocktails, and downstairs we bought Beleave t-shirts – a perfect [wild dog shirt](https://beleave.co.za/product/mens-wild-dog-grey/) not in my size.

## Day 10 - Miss much?

The sessions I missed were quiet; not much seen on Monday night, Tuesday the dogs were south and out of reach. Wednesday morning however – another uncollared cheetah was with a kill on the roadside. They’d darted him and tried to collar, but once again the attempt was unsuccessful. When I re-entered Mkhuze with PJ I found the cheetah still near the kill, a single dart in his rear, the drug not injected correctly. There were no more darts to try again.

### Night of the jumping beans

After the morning’s drama there was no time to sort out the rhino camera traps. We went straight there; it was sunny and warm when we left, but turned cold quickly, shorts perhaps wasn’t the best idea. There was a road with fresh rhino tracks and recently used middens; we attached a camera on an appropriate tree.

While waiting there was an odd noise, like rain, but we had clear skies. On closer inspection it was coming from beneath a bush, small little _nuts_ were all hopping about, by themselves. I picked one up and held it in my hand, palm flat, not touching it, it jumped, then jumped again. What is this black magic? We took  the _beans_ and cut one open, inside was a grub, its powerful flicking motion was causing the beans to hop about. They were tambouti jumping beans; their fruit are often parasitised by a moth.

## Day 11 - Lions and riddles

Probably the coldest morning I had. Clear skies, bitterly cold wind, the day’s forecast was a scorcher though; from 11C it would reach 37C. I wrapped myself in a blanket to buffet the wind chill. Today we hoped to find MLF4 and MLF5. The signal took us to dense thicket where we found a single lion, one which quickly moved out of sight. Here on the roadside we waited for them.

To pass the time we told riddles; things you put in toasters; secret passwords to get into secret clubs; forty foreheads; I have a bed but don’t sleep; something the poor has and the rich need. Of course we had coffee and rusks here too; debating which rusk brand is best; Ouma or Spar’s own. A quiet morning, but it was sunny and soon warmed up, and we were all in good company.

We didn’t spot the lions again, and left for the Kalihari males in the boma. For the birders, myself included, an exciting sighting; an uncommon juvenile hooded vulture, outside of its normal range.

By now we’d turned the kitchen table into an office; I wrote my blog notes, Kelly typed up our sightings, triangulations and notes, Brendan studied his psychology notes and PJ worked on reports, playing us his good music. “Uhh, do you have those TPS reports?”

### Team power-up and braai

To help us monitor in the south, monitor of monitors Cole would come and help. He’d stay with us, and travel down south on a dirt bike to check on the dogs and other priority species we couldn’t reach. Tonight though we’d go in search of MCM17 and MCM18, two monitors scanning, we drove to the north-western peninsula, over rocky terrain, along narrow fence lines, searching for the cheetah. By nightfall we hadn’t found them, we settled on a triangulation and headed back for a braai, seeing what looked like a suni on the way back – but it might also have been a baby grey duiker.

Joris stoked the fire and we threw on butternut squash and jacket potatoes, steak and sausage. Around the fire we listened to Moby, we stared at the stars, we talked about legendary leopard sightings and the warm evening was perfect. Two bush babies climbed along the phone lines, joining us for the braai. Nowhere I’d rather have been.

## Day 12 - Sightings dry-up

A few days now and we hadn’t seen much. The animals were being elusive or unreachable. Today was no different, I didn’t take a photo all day. Cole took the bike south and tried to locate the dogs, he got a brief visual but couldn’t get a signal for Zile. We searched for MLF4 and MLF5 in the morning, and MCM17 and MCM18 in the evening, no sightings of either. Our telemetry was also playing up, that didn’t help. In our down time we all played Tuper, a Dutch card game, or 30 seconds – a game that’s at every Wildlife Act reserve.

## Day 13 - Back in business, building roads

Today we found our luck again, well, when it came to wildlife. At 4:30am the morning began unexpectedly warm, which was a good start. We focused on WD6 who were now in the north, we struggled with the failing telemetry – the signal kept coming and going, but we endeavoured, and to our fortune we found Esweni sleeping in the road. Madikwe 3 was sleeping to our right, and Madikwe 2 was pacing up and down, like he wanted to hunt or eat or something. Some very lucky tourists also stumbled on this sighting, the dogs came right up to their car. I saw my first grey-headed bush shrike, amongst a group of cape glossies.

Cole went south on the bike again; he found the dogs, he found the elephants, he found the dogs toying with the elephants, the elephants trumpeting, he found the lions, he found them while he was up a tree getting signal, they ran past chasing a nyala – not the best timing. Everything is that much more risky on a bike, and the dogs weren’t as comfortable with it. Still no signal for Zile, which was becoming a worry. We’d need to try again tonight.

Our rhino camera traps didn’t yield any pictures, we stopped up for coffee and enjoyed the sunshine, keeping an eye out for any passing odd-toed ungulates. At some point we must have driven over a thorny acacia, a spine had been lodged in the tyre and on the tar road home the _hissing_ indicated a flat; Team Africa tyre change. Like a well-oiled formula 1 team, we watched PJ do all the hard work.

### Game counts in a hide

Cole and PJ needed to test and fix some radio electronics, in the meanwhile Team Africa headed to a hide to do a game count. We needed to sex and age all the mammals that visited over a 3 hour period. The time flew by. With cashews and carrot snacks, binoculars, cameras, guide books and a data sheet, we sat it out in the wooden hut, looking out for creatures great and small.

On arrival we encountered a troupe of chacma baboons, 14 we counted (3AF, 3AM, 6SF, 2J), with difficulty – they didn’t stop moving. Some were drinking, some were in trees, some were fighting. In the water, a rare visitor, a rhino. It stayed for almost two hours, sleeping – the oxpeckers feasted on its ticks, the turtles tried to climb it like a rock. The silence around the hide often interrupted with the bubbling gurgles of a prolonged rhino fart.

We thought the baboons were hard, then the impala arrived, they were 51 strong. We had 18 nyala, 3 plains zebra, 3 vervet monkeys and their turquoise underwear and 7 wildebeest, plus a single slender mongoose. The trees too were filled with birds, in the blooming boer tree there were 8 species at once; orioles, starlings, sunbirds, scimitars, weavers and doves.

### Finding Zile

For two days now we’d had no signal for alpha female Thandezile. We needed to find her, we memorised her markings from the ID kit – orange shoulder pads, speckles of white on her front legs. From the hide we went straight out on our evening session. Our first obstacle, a half finished bridge. Team Africa has the tools; with spades, pick-axe and panga machete we made a riverbed crossing besides the bridge. Shovelling dirt to smooth out the base, using machetes to remove shrubs, a pick-axe to break up the solid bank; we turned the steep river edges into a smooth route, passable in a 4x4. Once again, we opened up the south and we headed onwards with speed.

Zile’s collar gave us nothing, and we struggled to pick up Fezo’s. Nothing from the road, nothing from the dam, we crossed the road and followed a management track, heading to Cole’s last visual, hoping to find a beep. The track took us deep into a forest of fever trees, elephants had been here, and trunks and branches littered the route; a whole tree blocked our path, it was dry and light enough for us to lift and move out the way. The track hits a dead end, we turn back, still no signal.

It was incredibly good fortune that we then stumbled on the pack. Here they were, all of a sudden. Adults and puppies crossing the road. Snap, snap, snap; frantic photo taking as the dogs run across. “Did anyone see Zile?”, I check my photos, “Found her”, a collared dog with orange shoulder pads, a positive ID – she looked healthy, her collar must have died. An extraordinary relief, the tension lifted, success. Zile, 8 years old, she’s legendary.

Now we had the pleasure of watching the pack again. The dogs returned, they came out onto the road and we watched them in silence. Puppies and adults mingling around us. A sound came from the bushes, a rustling, we looked up, the dogs looked up; from the thicket a warthog sprinted, eyes wide open, running for its life, chased by a single dog. It flies past three dogs before they realise what’s happening, soon the pack is giving chase, the puppies react and run too, but don’t go far. Alpha male and female, Zile and Dumela, hang back, chilled, they scent mark and rest. The yearlings meander back, no luck with the hog, it got away. Now they all disappear, back into the thicket.

The night’s closing in and we’re all smiling, another incredible dog sighting. There’s a little of the evening left, we could find the lions or the elephants. We take GPS points and record the pack sightings, the scent marking, the hunt and the prey.

A little further on we find them again. These dogs have spoiled us. The adults are on a kill, a male impala, and they’re feeding frantically. One pulls up the head, the horns poking out, another runs off with a tasty leg; they come and go from the carcass, the puppies nearby, we could hear their twitters. They play, fight and run. The lions we would no longer search for began to vocalise a long way away; the dog reactions are astounding, they instantly stop everything and run, before calming and returning to finish.

Two of the dogs come right up to the bucky, they stand behind us, staring into the back, watching us, inspecting us. For one moment we fear they might jump on, they’re that close and that interested. We stay silent, breathing minimally, hearts racing, an intense moment shared with these wild animals.

The dogs leave one last time and its time to go, we drive all the way north in the dark, Cole using his new red lamp to search for nocturnal animals – he found a genet near to camp. A long day over, all dogs accounted for, a good day monitoring.

## Day 14 - Hiding in the hills

It was a cloudy 4:30am start, there was no rain, and it was surprisingly warm. Today we were searching for WD6 and the cheetah coalition, MCM18 and MCM18, who hadn’t been spotted for almost a week now. First stop; inflating all the tyres – it seems our adventure south may have created a few slow punctures. This mundane job was not without incident – an elephant was nearby; fresh dung steamed on the road and a tree was moving _unnaturally_. At the workshop we discovered the bull’s work, he had ripped open water pipes and now we had a small flood, water gushing everywhere.

With maintenance on route, we left on the hunt for our cheetah. WD6 were in the same direction. Two birds, one stone. We drove west, out into the hills, to find them. I hate this road, it looks fine, but drive it too fast and volunteers are flung left and right, shoulders bruised, heads bashed, like riding a bull. We found it hard to pinpoint the dogs or the cats, the hills bounce the signal. PJ attempted to find them from a viewpoint, he found only a unicorn. Further down the hill he did the same, walking into the bush for a quick survey, looking for the cheetah – we hear growls, he inadvertently bumps the dogs, and we have our visual. No luck on the cheetah though.

### To do at camp

Today we had all the volunteer duties; writing social media posts, washing the truck, replacing the gas, digging up an old cheetah skull – if we could find it. Out of gas, we planned a braai near the pan, one last hurrah before the evening session. The wind and rain put an end to that; instead we all played [toepen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toepen) around the kitchen table.

### Where are the cheetah?

Tonight the clouds turned heavy, storms threatened on the horizon. A message from Somkhanda, “Do you have storms too?”, Feline asked. In the distance, hills were masked with a curtain of rain. This’ll be fun. Lightning strikes in the distance. I’m on the roof, holding up the antenna, triangulating the cheetah. We get them at our 9 o’clock, but we have no visual, we triangulate and wait, the rain starts. From the back of the truck, a song, “gotta catch ’em all”, “our courage will pull us through”. Brendan’s got mad skills, a perfect rendition of the pokemon theme. No sightings tonight.

Joris cooked us his tasty chicken, Kelly prepped us a stir fry and over one last dinner we celebrated our two weeks. My group was all leaving, their time with Wildlife Act over, only I would stay, for just 2 more weeks. We reminisced, what an amazing time we’d had here, simply perfect – the perfect team; having the time of our lives. Then we drank beer and played “30 seconds”.

## Day 15 - One more time

Our last day; my last day at Mkhuze, my group’s last day with Wildlife Act. Time enough for one more trip down south. At 4am the five of us, plus Cole and PJ, hurtled south, stars poked through the scattered clouds. We cross our makeshift river crossing and continue, reaching the south before the sun’s up, but we struggle to get any signal; down to one collar, this might be tricky.

On the main road we stop to try again, a 360 sweep without beeps, gain on full. The elephants are here, and we bump a small herd to our right. They eye us carefully before crossing the road, quietly shifting back into the dark. We search everywhere for signal; up and down the main roads, along the border fence, up into the hills. We find slain trees, their trunks blocking roads, scarred by elephants. An old wildebeest carcass is being gorged on by vultures; one is tagged – M038 says the yellow triangle, we record it. No dogs though. “All I want is some coffee and dogs”, Cole says.

It’s almost time to go, and we start our journey north again, stopping one more time besides the dam to get signal. And there it is, a faint beep; Fezo’s collar has resurfaced. The chase is on, we turn back and head the way we came, following the signal, it’s getting louder now, we’re closing in, back up into the hills, _beep_, _beep_, _beep_. “Dogs!”.

The pack are in the road, with their puppies. Gompie stares at us, his ear bent over, blood on his face; they’ve made their morning kill. They’re all moving up and down the road, puppies running ahead, chaperoned by adults, they stop and start – sniffing everything inquisitively. A small puddle gives them all a drink. We follow them for as long as we can, until they hop over an impassable tree and we have to let them be. Goodbye WD2, goodbye Zile and Dumela and all your puppies; good luck and be good.

We share in one last coffee and rusks; the truck parked up on the hill, views out across the reserve, sun shining, a grey-helmeted bush shrike calling nearby. On the dirt track we sit and ponder, kick rocks, tell stories – this has been a little bit special. Good times; the best of times. But it’s ending now, and we need to leave, there are flights to catch, life needs to resume, “is this the last giraffe I’ll see?”.

On our last drive out of the park we savour each sighting; the baby giraffe still young and inquisitive, it doesn’t run, it just stares; the tortoise crossing the road in the mid-morning sunshine, the serval at the gate – waving us goodbye. Perhaps we imagined some of it. Team Africa has ended, 6 people returning to their _6_ different countries. Though my adventure continues for two more weeks, 2 weeks in Zululand Rhino Reserve, although it wouldn’t be quite the same.
