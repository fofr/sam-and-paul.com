From Hanoi, Vietnam we fly south, to Siem Reap, Cambodia.

Our flight from Hanoi touched down in Siem Reap at 8pm, and we were greeted by a decadent tiny airport that might well have been an extension of a five star hotel; evoking luxury and historical significance. With our freshly stamped visas we entered Cambodia.

A man from our hotel met us, but we wasn't holding our names. Confusion ensued, there were a couple of phone calls, a bit of waiting, a mild panic that we'd booked the wrong dates, and then we were on our way. Our driver was very kind, and en-route he talked about Cambodia's culture and history. Many of the older generations here speak French, he explained. He pointed out the sights in the dark; lavish new hotels that have popped up everywhere, new apartments, the oldest hotel in town. Siem Reap at night felt wealthy and new, the darkness smoothing over the rough edges. It's a town very much built on tourism, and mostly within the last decade.

Choosing our Siem Reap hotel was painless. One hotel stood out from the rest, the number one trip advisor recommendation where every review was glowingly positive, Pavillon D'Orient. It's a little out of town, but that is by no means a bad thing.

Cheerful staff were waiting our arrival, they helped us out of the car and emphatically greeted us. Welcome, welcome, sit down, have a cool lemongrass and jasmine tea. The staff were beaming, excitable even, eager to tell us all about breakfast, the restaurant, our complimentary tuk tuk and the temple tours. There was a lot to tell! A free spa treatment, all day breakfast, a temple guide book, a tuk-tuk for the duration of the stay; all included in our modest room rate.

We were shown to our room, through the small tropical garden and past the Indochine Angkor posters, old suitcases and Buddha statues, up the stairs. Along the corridor's ceiling the uncontrollable ants were chasing something sweet, avoiding the geckos that liked to snack on them.

The room was large, light brown and beige with a wooden floor. It got the, “Oh, wow” response from both of us. Even the mosquito nets were somehow romantic. A balcony with seats looked out towards the pool, and a writing desk had fresh fruit, complimentary red wine and an intriguing paper maché sculpture.

Not yet 10pm, we were starving; the hotel restaurant was a delight and a lifesaver. Over scrumptious beef and shrimp salads, with the watchful attention of our waitresses, we planned tomorrow's itinerary. We had four full days, three full days of temple trekking and a day off to recover, somewhere in-between. But which were the best temples? What does the guide book say for a three-day trip? Which order should we see them in? What do all these names mean!?

At 10:20 there was a power cut. Under the torch light of my phone we continued planning. The smells of the mosquito repellant wafted upwards, as the bugs were drawn to our bright light. Soon the generator kicked in and we were back to normal. Turns out this is a nightly affair.

Despite all these questions, and the barrage of information that faces any visitor to the region, we made a decent plan. Tomorrow we'll visit Bayon, Angkor Thom and the surrounding regions. And we'll book a guide, if we can, to explain everything.

Right, we're done, we've eaten, we have our plans and now we must sleep and, once more this holiday, prepare for an early morning.

<!--nextpage-->

Not for the first time, the iPhone alarm beckoned, and we crawled out of bed some minutes after 6am. Fresh and ready for the day (the hotel's Jasmine shampoo was lovely!), we descended to breakfast, which had a good spread. Tropical fruits, toast, coffee, good croissants, cooked eggs and smoothies.

Outside we met out tuk-tuk driver, Vesna, his name was spelt in the red upholstery. After a trip to the ATM, where the unhelpful cash machine spat out crisp $100 bills, we met our guide for the day. By 8am we were on our way to the temples. Our guide, I can't remember his name, was wide faced and a little stocky, at least by Cambodian scales. His little finger had a long, vicious looking nail. It's a status symbol, to show he's not doing manual labor. Somewhat freaky, but it's commonplace across Asia and we're used to it by now.

At the park entrance we had our photos snapped and our tickets bore our faces. Do not lose this! An official punched a hole in the card and we were in, just as a VIP cavalcade of black 4x4s rolled past.

The road into the park was straight and narrow. To the sides were metal roofed huts and dogs ran about the place, the occasional macaque looked for food amongst the dwellings. We continued straight past the magnificent west-facing Angkor Wat, towards Angkor Thom.

Angkor means “city”, our guide told us. “Wat” means temple, which we knew already, and “Thom” means great or big. Angkor Thom is literally the big city.

We approached via the south gate. A bridge crosses a huge manmade moat, and the gate is a decorated narrow archway leading through a towering wall, into the walled city. The bridge is lined with 54 demon gods and guardian gods, good and evil, each holding the body of a giant snake. The snake's head would've been at the front, its tail, it's believed, is in the kingdom of the gods. Many of the figures were eroded, faces melted by weathering over centuries of wet seasons. Others were renovated or replaced. The gate is topped with a tower, which bears four faces looking in each direction and elephants at its foot, controlled by the Hindu god Indra.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![A guardian god at the south gate of Angkor Thom](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/angkor-wat--001.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--001.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">A guardian god at the south gate of Angkor Thom</figcaption></figure>
It was already pretty busy, but being the wet season it was, apparently, much quieter than most other times of year. It had seemed like it might rain, but the skies cleared up, and our umbrellas began their dual use as a parasol.

There are five gates into Angkor Thom and they all converge on Bayon temple. We drove onwards, in our red outfitted tuk-tuk, our guide riding backwards. To our first temple, Bayon, the crazy magnificent Bayon. It is Angkor Thom's centrepiece. Like most temples it faces East, I forget the reasoning, and it has three levels. It is crowned with scattered towers adorning approximately 200 Lokesvara faces, a bodhisattva, which embodies the compassion of all Buddhas.

Our guide begun with the outermost galleries, or gopura if you like. These stone galleries showed traditional Angkorian Khmer life, and the occasional historic event. Our guide finds a spot and tells us a story, that's his style, carved into the stone are the Khmer army, a Chinese army and Cham forces, distinguishable by their clothing and stretched ears. Amongst the soldiers were scenes of a cockfight, a market, boats and fishermen, and a man being bitten by a turtle. As Sam takes in everything I sneak about the corridors attempting to find a mystical photo minus blue shirted tourist.

Inside and up to the first level, an inner gallery, the carvings here are purely religious, with many dancing Hindu gods. Beyond the inner gallery is the second level, the upper terrace, an open pathway that circles the central tower and sanctuary. Here the tourists gather and pose with the giant Bayon faces, up close and personal. Naturally we did the same. The faces are always in a formation of four, one looking in each direction, with varying degrees of preservation. Many still look stunning, and peculiar. Our guide knows all the best photo spots.

The sun is out, and away from the shade it's unbearable. Beneath the umbrellas we wiped away the sweat with baby wipes. A Japanese tourist sits on the ancient stone railings, cooling herself with a fan, atop a sign reading, “Don't sit on the balustrades”.

After a quick exploration of the dark central tower we climb down and exit Bayon. We look back at the beautiful odd thing from a distance, as an elephant and tuk tuk go by.

We walked North West to Baphuon, a temple painstakingly restored by the French. It opened to the public in April 2011, after some 51 years of restoration. In the sixties it was disassembled and labelled for reconstruction, but the work was halted and the plans destroyed by the Khmer Rouge. It's a three tiered temple mountain (representing Mount Meru); you see, we're temple experts now, using official terminology! Ha. As usual with Angkorian temples, the religion flip-flopped from Hindu to Buddhist and back again, depending on the religious taste of the king. A huge 70m long reclining Buddha sits on the West side.

Once more we sat down amongst the stones to listen to a story. I idly watch the butterflies flit about by a reflection pool. Sam meanwhile discusses Cambodian-Vietnamese-Thai relations, and recent tensions. A long bridge to our right leads up to the temple.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Baphuon temple](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/angkor-wat--028.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--028.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Baphuon temple</figcaption></figure>

We're left to explore the temple; up our first set of steep temple steps. Each level resembles a completed jigsaw, lovingly pieced together. From the top we took in the views, the reflection pools and bridge stretching out beneath us, and disappearing into a thick canopy, the trees too tall to see much else. The sun is out, and it's getting hotter, Sam's Vietnamese hat is working wonders; shade and air flow. Essential headwear. Down the west side we saw the pieced together remains of the giant Buddha.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![From the top of Baphuon, Sam looking somewhat nervous](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/angkor-wat--031.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--031.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">From the top of Baphuon, Sam looking somewhat nervous</figcaption></figure>

Not yet lunch time and to our third temple, Phimeanakas, via an ancient tree with a human nose. “There's no story for this one”, the guide said. No matter, we clambered and explored the 10th century temple, over a thousand years old and still standing, despite everything. It would've been close to the ancient royal palace, though that was a wooden masterpiece, and has since disappeared.

Further on we come out onto the Elephant Terrance and the Terrace of the Leper King. Our guide did a poor job of explaining this one, but from here the king would watch huge processions pass by, usually of his victorious returning army. By now we were very tired and hot, and there's no shade on the terrace. As sweat poured down our faces the guide asked, “Lunch?”. At the tuk-tuk Vesna pulls out a bottle of ice cold water, “Oh wow, yes please, thank you ever so much”.

We ate at a small restaurant in front of Angkor Wat; rice, curry and cold drinks. We also encountered our first experience of children trying to sell us stuff, aggressively. Postcards, “You buy! One doll-ar”, “Ten postcards. 1-2-3… 10”, “You don't want? What you want? Cold water? Drink? Scarf?”. Kids as young as five, up to 14\. “You buy later. I wait for you”.

Post-lunch we head out to Angkor Wat, in the searing mid-afternoon heat. It is however one of the quieter times to visit. Like Angkor Thom, Angkor Wat is surrounded by a manmade moat, with a bridge into the complex. The bridge is adorned with Naga snakes, and a recent French recreation of a Naga's head sits at the front, Sam marvelled at its intricate detail. At the entrance the stone pillars are littered with bullet wounds, shots fired during the Vietnam war, in a siege that saw the Khmer defending their beloved temple.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--portrait">[![Bullet holes at Angkor Wat](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/angkor-wat--038.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--038.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Bullet holes at Angkor Wat</figcaption></figure>

Inside the grounds were luscious, and the grasses green. Beyond two libraries, one either side of the path, were the famous reflecting pools. We posed against the reflections, Angkor Wat's five towers visible behind us.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Posing by the famous reflection pools](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/angkor-wat--039.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--039.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Posing by the famous reflection pools</figcaption></figure>

Having dodged more souvenir pedlars, we entered the vast temple. It's surrounded by an outer gallery, with detailed stonework illustrating classic Hindu stories. The important details of each bas relief are highlighted, made shiny after years of groping by tourists and guides alike.

Oh dear, Sam's looking a little peaky, the heat's getting to her and she needs to rest. She went pale, and we cut short our tour of the galleries. We rested inside by four old water pools, now devoid of any actual water. Here there was once a gallery of a thousand Buddhas, but they've all gone too. Amongst the moss covered rooftops, dancing Apsara figures and muddy red inscribed pillars, we sat silently, taking time out to relax and enjoy what tranquility we had. We watched people pray and make offerings to a Buddha statue by the pools.

The temples have been subject to centuries of pillaging, whatever valuable artefacts there once were are long gone. All but stone left, too heavy to plunder, the temples feel like shells of their former selves, Angkor Wat included.

With Sam regaining a bit of colour, I carried her bag and we headed inwards, via a couple more galleries. Ah yes, there was also an unfortunate event with some ants. Tired, Sam had rested against a pillar as we heard about another Hindu story. Mid prophecy she proclaimed, “ANTS! Ants!”, they were climbing up the pillar behind her in their hundreds, and now Sam had them in her hair. She did the ant dance, hands waving, legs flapping, and we moved on.

We crossed into the centre of the temple, an enclosed courtyard with a towering holy level in the middle. The precarious ancient steps up to this level are now closed, in favour of a new, wooden route complete with queuing system – surely a very recent addition.

From the top level we had views out across the Angkor plains, trees spread out in every direction. A yellow bulb of a helium balloon bobbed amidst the forest. Everything is so very flat, and there's no high rises or buildings to spoil the view, just a dusty haze. I wonder how long it will stay like that with tourism booming. A monk dressed in orange passed us by, quietly placing golden metal petals on each of the Buddha statues, some sort of ritual we couldn't understand. We stayed up here for a while, the cool breeze that passes through the windows is lovely, and it's quiet too, relaxing.

We left Angkor Wat, passing a macaque on the way out. I think it really is best from the outside, it looks simply fabulous. Inside is a little disappointing, a shadow of its former self. Although it was never quite finished, many carvings lie half finished. Late afternoon now, the sun still burning, we asked about the best place for a sunset. “Bakheng”, our guide recommended, a mountain temple atop a hill.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Angkor Wat, from the entrance](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/angkor-wat--050.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--050.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Angkor Wat, from the entrance</figcaption></figure>

As we climbed the spiralling gravel walkway up the hill the clouds materialised (as if out of thin air). From the summit the views are event more spectacular. In the distance is Tonle Sap, an enormous lake. The temple itself is one of the oldest, 889 AD or so. Sadly much of the reverence of this temple is lost, as people use it only as a viewing platform.

By now the clouds had turned to rain, and as we sheltered under an umbrella we realised there wouldn't be a sunset worth watching. Slowly people left, and eventually we didn't have a choice. The officials closed the temple early. No sunset tonight folks. Time to go. Disappointing, but I didn't feel like we were missing much. It was like this every night of our time here, no beautiful sunsets to be had.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![No sunset tonight](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/angkor-wat--052.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--052.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">No sunset tonight</figcaption></figure>

On the tuk-tuk home the darkness set in. Our guide had helped with a lot of things, but he wasn't stellar, we didn't choose to have a guide on any of our future temple visits.

Back at the hotel we recovered from the intense day, and stayed within the hotel for the evening. Our hotel food was quite excellent, and cheap, and we ordered more of the spicy salad, and today's Khmer dessert specials, Nhom Bagn Bev. It's hard to describe, it's sort of like semolina cubes. Anyway, I tried it, and I'm happy I did, but I wouldn't again.

What a thoroughly exhausting day. We went to sleep with a Cambodian bed time story, from a rolled piece of paper on my pillow.

<!--nextpage-->

Temple trekking day two, another early start. The hotel brought our orders at 7am, already learning what we like. It was an overcast morning, and we were glad not to have woken at 4am for the famed Angkor Wat sunrise.

To Ta Prohm, by tuk tuk, to the temple I was most anticipating. It lies to the east of Angkor park. Ta Prohm is the temple taken back by nature, (also known as the Tomb Raider temple, I'll let you guess why). Here roots, branches and trunks intertwine with rocks, foundations and temple carvings. A temple where nature has run its course for over half a millennia.

As one of the first tuk-tuks to arrive, the kids selling items were energetic, and eager to make an early sell. They pounced on us, seven or eight, all at once; postcards, musical instruments (“one doll-ar morning discount”), guidebooks, and more. None of it we wanted, and we walked briskly away, eventually they stopped following us.

The temple is reached via a long muddy path. The air was misty and eerie, the path empty but for a photographer and tripod, returning from his sunrise photo shoot. At the entrance, a shaky temple wall, a small mound and a great tree rising up. Seemingly the middle of nowhere.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--portrait">[![Ta Prohm](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/angkor-wat--053.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--053.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Ta Prohm</figcaption></figure>

But the mysticism and wonder were quickly dispelled. On entering, into the most picturesque and famous part of the temple, a renovations work crew were having their morning meeting. In yellow hard hats, against a truck and a giant crane, these workmen prepared for their day of restoration. Not the serene jungle setting I had expected, “inconvenience caused is regretted” a sign said. Brand new boardwalks and ropes protect the temple and tree roots from visitors, but also scar whatever photos you might hope to capture.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Workmen at Ta Prohm](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/angkor-wat--057.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--057.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Workmen at Ta Prohm</figcaption></figure>

Sam wasn't feeling great, and she had to wander back up the muddy path to find a “happy room”, as it is called here. Leaving me to explore this place by myself, armed with a digital SLR and a gorilla tripod.

Beyond the opening disappointment the temple is everything I'd expected and hoped for. Through surviving ancient corridors I wandered, discovering eerie, hidden chambers, and ancient rooms filled with rubble. Some passageways are marked as dangerous, whilst others are held up by metal supports. Moss damaged stone and leaves litter the floor. Roots are carving through stone walls, bouldering them over. A delicate balance between nature and temple lies throughout, and it's stunning.

I wandered around carefree for an hour or so, three laps of this amazing place, finding something new each time. In an empty opening, amongst the roots of an ancient tree, I sat, listening to the birds, the sounds of the jungle, the rustling of the leaves, watching the swaying of the trees. I must've stayed here for ten minutes or so, uninterrupted.

The mist cleared up, and gave way to rain. And at the temple's traditional entrance I eventually bumped into Samantha. We continued to look around, this time posing for photos at every corner. Beneath the spidery trunk, in front of the temple, in a fallen archway, next to a colossal trunk, posing with umbrellas.

We had no guide this time, but there wasn't any need for one. With the muddy paths and heavy rain, the temple remained quiet and serene, with the exception of an occasional flash of yellow poncho jutting from a corridor.

We spent most of our morning here, and it was my favourite of all the Angkor temples. Stunningly beautiful. I hope future renovations and tourists do not destroy this place.

By tuk-tuk we travelled to our next temple, Ta Keo. Vesna warned us to be careful on the slippery steps, and after one look Sam decided to stay at the bottom. But I climbed away, up two flights of steps. At the summit was a small Buddha statue where a lady explained the dedication process to me. Sam has been wearing a red cotton band, given as a thank you for a donation she made, the red means happiness, I am told. Coming back down was more difficult, and I watched as a Japanese group clambered down backwards, edging slowly and surely, a Cambodian selling paintings skipped down past them.

A little on from here lie Thommanon and Chau Say Tevoda. These two temples sit opposite each other, and anywhere else in the world these ancient buildings would be major tourist sites in their own right. But here, against the ruins that are the rest of Angkor, they are overlooked. “Another temple”, temple fatigue quickly sets in.

Hungry, and a little tired, Vesna convinced us to visit Preah Khan (meaning Holy Sword) before lunch. It's a flat temple to the north of the park, and one which people had lived within, up to 100,000 officials and servants. It combined the roles of a city, temple and Buddhist university, and is one of the larger temples.

There was a muddy trek to this temple, but the rain had gone, replaced with hot hot sunshine. The path was filled with butterflies, and rhododendrons, and, at last, I saw my first snake in the wild, a little brown one that I watched from a safe distance.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Butterfly and rhododendrons](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/angkor-wat--082.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--082.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Butterfly and rhododendrons</figcaption></figure>

We entered the temple through a narrow alleyway, and the ruins stretched out ahead of us. Corridors every which way, we meandered around, with no particular direction. Oh dear, this route has led us to a dead end, a corridor blocked by fallen stone. The wall carvings here are magnificent. This temple, too, is succumbing to nature, trees have grown up and around the walls, the reclamation has begun.

Without a guide you discover a new group of people that attempt to sell you things, randoms that wander the temples and attempt to sell you a tour, “this is a big temple”, one pointed out to me. I smiled and kept walking. An official guide was standing amidst the ruins and Sam asked about his uniform, and the patch he wore, “you like? you want to buy?” he responded.

We decided on a clockwise tour of the complex, and narrowly avoided the postcard selling teenager. Once again nature caught my eye, beneath us on broken rocky path giant termites were pacing up and down, thousands of them. These things pack a nasty bite, but I stooped close to watch. On the way out we passed beneath a path-spanning web, with its creator, a giant wood spider, sitting in the middle, its body almost six inches long. Another tick in my imaginary “I spy” nature book, a giant wild spider.

Starving, our tuk-tuk took us back to our hotel. But not before a roadside stop to grab some one dollar sticky rice in bamboo.

Relaxing by the hotel pool, with a pineapple smoothie, we made a speedy recovery from Angkor temple fatigue. Comforting western food helped too, guilty chips and tuna sandwich. I wrote about our travels, we slept and we showered (always showering; bug spray, dirty feet, sweat, sun lotion, dirt, chlorine; three times daily, with the jasmine-bacon scented soap).

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--square">[![Relaxing by the pool](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/IMG_5425.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/IMG_5425.JPG)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Relaxing by the pool</figcaption></figure>

In the evening Vesna dropped us off in Siem Reap, pub street, for dinner. But in the heavy rain it made for a miserable atmosphere. Frustrated, we slopped about in the wet, every five minutes hounded by a tuk-tuk driver. If we're looking at menus we probably don't want a ride somewhere else. Nowhere took our fancy, and we settled on the minimalist upstairs of the Blue Pumpkin cafe.

Tasty wontons and a huge vanilla ice-cream milkshake, and not so delightful fishy mains. Though this is a delicatessen cum cafe, and not a restaurant. Perhaps a fancy Tonle Sap fish meal here wasn't the best of ideas in the first place. Downstairs we bought chocolate cake and brownie for dessert, and headed home.

Another night at Pavillon D'orient, and another bed time story beneath the mosquito net.

Thursday, and our day off from the temples. We wondered what to do with the day, should we see the floating village on stilts? Or drive to the nearby mountain? Decisions, decisions. None of it quite took our fancy, and nearing the end of our holiday we decided to have a simple holiday-do-nothing-day.

After breakfast we lounged by the pool, I read about the new iPhone 5, we had nice drinks, we swum, read some things. A whole lot of nothing really, and it was especially good. The fake waterfall trickled as we rested, the water was cool and the heat much more bearable. Around the pool small yellow, white and black striped birds danced, flitting between the tree branches. And a trail of ants, as ever, ran about the place, as busy as ever.

Ready to do something by the afternoon, we went out for a short shopping trip. Our room had a lovely paper mache sculpture that looked like stone, I liked it and wanted to see more, so we took the tuk-tuk over to the artist's studio and had a look. We bought a Bayon looking sculpture, a face protruding from a wall, with vines all about the place – it resembled the temples, was original, and it looked great. Getting it home in one piece? That's a problem for another day!

We also stopped at a terribly touristy mall, of our own choosing, where the staff followed us around, despite our asking them not to.

It had been drizzling throughout the afternoon, but it cleared up in the evening, and we returned to Siem Reap. A warm, dry night, this place felt radically different; it had life. After perusing the night market we sat down to eat at the Cambodian BBQ.

Five meats; chicken, beef, squid and the more interesting snake and crocodile. In the middle of our table stood a nested barbecue. The meat and side dishes come out raw; using chopsticks or tongs, we pulled apart the raw meat and placed them, sizzling, onto a metal dome. Beneath the meat, water, noodles and vegetables formed a broth, and there was a side of rice. We waited patiently for the meat to cook through, small slithers, one at a time. The food wasn't gourmet, but the experience was novel. We washed it all down with some Laosbeer.

Vesna drove us home again, as we devoured our Blue Pumpkin ice creams.

<!--nextpage-->

Of all the early mornings, this was the earliest. 4:30am our alarm beckoned. Vesna met us at 4:45am and we were swiftly off to Angkor Wat; because getting up so early on holiday is what we clearly enjoy doing. It was a restless night too, dreaming about the temples and constantly waking, believing we'd missed dawn.

Every morning so far had been overcast, and a little grim. But as we sped towards the park there were only ruffles of cloud amidst sparkling stars. (Yep, that early). We cruised through the dark pre-dawn morning streets of Siem Reap, where the few folks up at this time were preparing for the day ahead, as I'm sure they did everyday. On the main road to Angkor we joined a procession of tuk-tuks, a tourist parade leading straight to the Wat. A daily ritual.

We foolishly thought there might not be any hard sellers. Ha. Of course there were, only this time they were older, and selling coffee and torches. “No thank you”, we said, standing outside the entrance to Angkor Wat. Through the dark we trekked, using Sam's wind up torch to light the path ahead, over the moat, down the main promenade and left past the library, towards the reflecting pool.

We arrived before many of the crowds, and staked a spot by the edge of the water. Our tiny gorilla tripod primed for the sunrise, manually focused on the central spire, too dark to auto focus. There was no wind, and it was a “cool” 26C, probably the most pleasant time of the day.

As the crowds grew larger, the sky grew brighter; every few seconds a flash would fire, as if the camera could light up the ancient monument. People always do that. The stronger the light, the sharper I could focus the camera, and soon the long exposures were coming out fantastic. A two second exposure quickly reduced to less than a second.

Sun rise was at 6:02am. And a slight orange haze came over the place, a morning mist blew in, and the towers were ethereal. The sun rise wasn't spectacular, there were still too many clouds, and nothing could match what we'd seen in Halong Bay, but it was beautiful nonetheless. I enjoyed the patience necessary to get a good photo.

Before heading back we took two more quick stops. First to the south gate, empty for now, we played amidst the statues and took photos. Vesna yawned, he was clearly very tired, though I imagine he has to do this a lot, we were very grateful. With our picture of an empty bridge and gate, save for a solitary cyclist, we left for Bayon. I hadn't been happy with the pictures we took a couple of days back, I knew I could do better. Once more, crazy Bayon was astounding, and this time empty. I stood in front and snapped geese preparing for their day, in front of the many towers of faces, watched from every angle. And from the corner, with Vesna's recommendation, I captured more photos, this time with the aid of a reflection pool. I think the shots came out fantastic.

Alas, that's enough, and all of a sudden we needed to sleep again. Back at the hotel by 7:45am, we slept for a good few hours and woke afresh, ready for the day. And we consumed a mammoth breakfast to boot.

Today's temple itinerary was obvious. First stop, Banteay Srei, 40km out of town, about an hour by tuk tuk, and a journey through Cambodia's countryside and rural roads. Rice paddies stretched out to the hills in the distance, and farmworkers stooped in them, transplanting rice which'll be harvested later in the year.

Casually minding my own business, and rather enjoying the ride, I felt a sudden and very painful jab in my right arm. Looking down, some huge bug had attached to me, without enough time to really see it, or identify it, I brushed it off. “Ow, owww, OW OW OW. What was that? Am I poisoned? OW!”. The wound started to swell instantly, but the ice cold water bottles helped numb it. I remain in a lot of pain for the rest of the journey, Sam is talking a lot, but I'm not hearing most of her words (or fewer than usual). The pain stopped after an hour or so, and it was probably some form of wasp that stung me. I feared it might've been a spider.

We arrived at Banteay Srei, a modern complex, newly built and with an attached museum. The hard selling locals were more upmarket too, they had DVDs in many languages.

Before entering I was shocked and horrified by the appearance of a Cambodian girl trying to sell postcards. Probably only a teenager, she had a stifled zombie-like walk, and had suffered horrific third degree burns on her face and body, presumably from unexploded ordinance or a land mine. I've never seen someone scarred so irrecoverably, and seemingly without any ongoing care. She genuinely scared me, and I am appalled at my own reaction to this poor girl's plight.

The temple is famous for its red sandstone and intricate stone carvings, they've survived for a thousand years, and thanks to the nature of the stone, their pristine detail is still intact. A gravel track leads to the small temple. It's a Hindu temple, dedicated to Shiva, and the buildings are tiny. But the level of detail and intricacy in the carvings is incredible, it is the “jewel of khmer art”.

A Cambodian family explored the grounds with us; seven kids were running about, hiding amongst the ruins, jumping in the water pools, hiding from staff members.

The weathered pink sandstone occasionally opened up great crevices, perfect places for lizards to hide. In particular a beautiful foot-long blue and red spotted Tockay Gecko. It poked its head out, and then scarpered.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![A Tockay Gecko](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/620/angkor-wat--101.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--101.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">A Tockay Gecko</figcaption></figure>

The carvings were everywhere. We admired those on top of the gopuras, following the notes in our guide book to understand the depictions. So detailed and beautiful, the more you look the more you see. We spotted the ten headed ten armed Ravana ourselves. There were demons eating people or being attacked. The burning of the Khāṇḍava Forest and many devatas, celestial dancing girls, sprinkled about the corners.

At the museum, where placards hang from the ceiling, the stories of the temple's history are told. The discovery, the restoration, the famous attempted pilfering by André Malraux. Outside the storm rains briefly returned, and they battered down on the metal roof. The rain had such force and tenacity, pummelling the delicate lotus flowers. But it soon cleared up again.

We headed back towards Siem Reap. Vesna suggested we shout if there was anything we wanted to see more of, or learn about. We stopped by the rice paddies, and watched the farmworkers transplanting rice, they smiled as we took photos, and waved goodbye when we left.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Working in the rice paddies](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/angkor-wat--119.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/angkor-wat--119.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Working in the rice paddies</figcaption></figure>

We stopped by a house that had piles of wood outside. The families farm the wood and cut it into 1m lengths. A lorry came by to pick up the stock to sell at market. The house was wooden, built on stilts, presumably to avoid flooding. Tyres lay strewn on hay rooftops, to keep them down in strong winds. Most houses were wooden, the occasional stone house belonged to a politician or important figure.

We stopped again, this time to peruse some street side vendors. They were making sweets from palm sugar they'd harvested nearby. Young girls were stirring the sugary syrup in great metal bowls. The sweets were tasty too, we bought a couple for $1, wrapped in banana leaf packaging. Sam bought a scarf and pashmina too, while I danced with a giant flying beetle I didn't fancy being close to. Then there were the waffles, just cooked, very hot, sweetened with palm sugar; simply delicious, and possibly the best waffles we've ever tasted.

Next stop on the temple tour was Banteay Samré, another of Vesna's recommendations. Girls at the entrance mobbed us, though this time they weren't annoying; politer, friendlier, with fun quizzical questions. They were trying to seek handmade Christmas decorations. In the heat of the moment (pun intended), Sam stood too close to the tuk-tuk, rubbed her leg against the hot engine and burnt herself. Out comes the ice water once again, to numb another wound.

The temple is red sandstone again, and an early mode for Angkor, I heard a local expert explain. A walled corridor surrounds the building, surprisingly intact all the way round. It's a flat temple, that used to have water pools, and it's peaceful and quiet. We crossed to the solitary central plinth and tower, which houses a Buddha. Sam sat here with an elderly man who explained parts of the temple, although she only understood half of what he said. A cat slept in one of the real windows, he's rock coloured and perfectly camouflaged. Meanwhile a cute girl is running around and playing with her family, but she has chicken pox, and I try to avoid her. Banteay Samré is a lovely place to explore; serene, quiet and sheltered.

Next on the temple checklist, and the last of all the temples we would see, Pre Rup, which means “turn the body”, funerals would've taken place here. Close to the Angkor park again, this temple mountain is one of the earliest, and noticeably made from small bricks, common for the era. The bricks are fascinating, layered up without any cementing agent, it's a miracle they're still standing 1200 years later.

For one last time we climb the steep steps of an ancient temple, no metal bars for support this time, Sam still braved the climb (it's going down that's hardest). From the top the forests spread out into the distance. There's a mound, which Banteay Srei sits at the foot of, and we can just make out the towers of Angkor Wat. Like every night we've been here, there isn't a spectacular sunset, though this would be a stunning place to watch one.

Early evening now, and starving, we head homeward. Goodbye temples, you are all remarkable. I hope you can survive for another millennium. And goodbye Vesna, our wonderful conscientious tuk-tuk driver, he was fantastic, especially today.

We remained in the hotel for some final relaxing, a bit of reading, some red wine, some food, a free spa treatment and, with one last Cambodian bed time story, sleep. What a truly wonderful time we've had here.

The final day of our three week holiday, it went slowly, it has felt like an eternity, but I can't help but want more.

We said our goodbyes to all the wonderful staff at Pavillon D'Orient and took a car to the small but lovely Siem Reap airport. We flew Cambodia Angkor Air to Ho Chi Minh city (Saigon). A total of 15 people were on the flight, including crew and pilot, and the plane had propellors. The small, old plane felt that little bit less safe, as it jigged and jumped amongst the strong winds and turbulence. The trip wasn't without its moments of fear for Sam, and she regularly gripped my hand. I pointed out she should only be afraid if the crew members look panicked. We flew over Tonle Sap and spotted floating villages on the riverbanks, and planned our Saigon itinerary, we'd have about six hours.
