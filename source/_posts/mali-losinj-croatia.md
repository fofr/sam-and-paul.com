We embarked on our second trip with a baby, this time going a little further afield than Malaga, and going to a country we’ve never been to before: Croatia.

As a family with a 7 month old we wanted a trip that would be quietly luxurious, with just enough to do, but not too much so that we’d feel like we were missing out. 10 days away with a baby in a hotel would be adventure enough.

Sam rolled the buggy down the hill from our flat in Brighton, while I pulled two 20 kilo bags either side of me, to the station. With Small Batch coffee in hand, we made the train with a full 5 seconds to spare. At Gatwick our nack for timing continued, with Sam getting squished between the monorail doors as she leapt on with buggy.

The train, monorail and plane were the easy bits of the journey. EasyJet once again looked after us with our baby, and the flight was only 2 hours. The tricky bit would be the 3 hour transfer by minibus from the airport to our hotel. Conway slept well on the plane, so was awake and unhappy for the drive, much to the chagrin of others in the vehicle with us. The drive took us from Pula, 1 hour north to a ferry terminal, then across to Cres. The road was nauseating as it weaved up, and around and down the island’s hills, though the views were fabulous.

The islands are brown and yellow beneath blue skies, their haze and heat balanced by the deep blue waters of the Mediterranean that surround them. Roads are lined with shingle walls and shrubs, trees are mostly pine, with an occasional olive. Where towns and gardens are cultivated there are pink oleander blooms bursting out over walls and between fences. Terracotta rooftops dot the landscape.

From Cres we crossed a bridge onto Losinj, then a second one over to Mali Losinj, our journey timed to avoid bridge closures that allow boats to pass.

We arrived to the plush coolness of Hotel Bellevue a little pale and sleepy.

## Hotel Bellevue

Hotel Bellevue is a modern white monolith that sits in a natural harbour to the North East of Mali Losinj. It’s surrounded by pine forest and is a stone’s throw from the sea.

The building’s exterior is an architectural monster, it stands out like a chalk rock in a field of grass. Unlike the refined buildings either side – stone built and terracotta roofed which peek through the pines, Bellevue is an unnatural white and beige beacon. At night it’s the only source of light pollution.

But on the inside it’s gorgeous. Sleek sofas in a wide open bar with views out to the sea, a breakfast area with outdoor seating in a secluded courtyard or on a terrace overlooking the pool. Inside the sharp corners and cool white works to create modern chic. As we walked through the hotel on our arrival tour, Conway arced his head to the ceilings, dazzled by all the new and shiny lighting he found there.

## Our room

The corridor to our room was low lit, with arches of cool LED light illuminating the way. As you pass through it feels like street lights when driving at night. Conway watched them fly by.

Our second floor room boasted a balcony and sea view, though for the most part it was obstructed by tall pine trees. Our bed was comfortable and enormous, and Conway made sure to roll around, jump and examine every bit of it with glee. He had his own cot too.

There was a safe, an overpriced minibar, a bath and shower and we had space for all our stuff, buggy and car seat included. The carpet was thick beneath our feet, and fresh linen always invited us to sleep a little more. We used the complimentary toiletries and enjoyed the indulgent smells of orange blossom and sandalwood.

Importantly the room felt soundproofed, perhaps our screaming and teething baby wouldn’t wake the other guests.

## Dinner at Diana

After family nap time we ventured out along the sea front. There’s little beach here, instead concrete platforms jut out into the water, with ladders into the sea for swimming. Where the shoreline bends around there’s a small shingle beach with some bars and it’s where the locals gather to bathe.

Further on there’s a couple of water polo pools demarked in the sea, and at weekends they’re filled with kids playing league matches – the whistles of the officials and the cheers from onlookers can be heard around the bay.

Tonight we stopped just beyond this to eat at Restaurant Diana. The first of very many meals we’d have out with Conway. He had his own high chair and we gave him rice cakes and crackers, and bits of salad to enjoy. It was here that he developed a fascination and taste for menus – apparently reading them intently before opting to eat them from the corner.

Diana specialise in steak, but we opted for burgers and the buns arrived with two great slabs of meat between them.  Plenty of food to tide us over until breakfast.

## Night of the poltergeist

Our relaxing holiday didn’t begin the way we’d hoped it might. After a tiring journey we needed a good night’s sleep, this didn’t happen.

With lights off and the air conditioning set to a relatively warm 23C, we settled for the night. I thought I’d slept through, when in the morning I could see light through my eyelids, but when I awoke the curtains were closed and all the lights were on. It was 1am. And it was cold, the aircon read 18C. I fixed everything and went back to sleep.

At 2am it happened again, waking both Sam and I as the lights all flickered on by themselves. We rushed to turn them off to avoid waking Conway. The aircon beeped occasionally and again it was chilling us to 18C.

This happened twice more, and happened between Conway’s night time feeds. Our night was very broken.

The room is modern. It uses a keycard to know when you’re in the room and turns on the power. When you enter the card it triggers a welcome mode that turns on the lights to greet you. It turns out that our card reader had trouble reading cards, and after a short while it’d forget there was a card in there, only to find it again – and assuming we’d walked in the room, it turned on all the lights. This is what happens when Smart Homes go wrong. In the morning the hotel replaced the reader and it didn’t happen again. But the aircon remained broken and we took to turning it off overnight.

## Breakfast

Thankfully breakfast at Hotel Bellevue runs until 11am, we could lie-in and still enjoy our morning meal.

And what a breakfast it is. We sat out on the terrace, a light wind ruffled the sunshades, Conway sat in a Stokke high chair and the waitress served us cappuccino then filter coffee. We took turns getting food from the buffet.

With plate in hand I perused the offerings. Bacon, sausage, fried eggs, potatoes, fried vegetables, frittata, boiled eggs – hard and soft, and eggs any way you want them. Freshly baked bread of all kinds, sourdough, with olive and sun dried tomatoes. Then a row of sweet pastries – croissants, swirls and grašnjaci, and freshly made pancakes – thick or thin.

And this is just the beginning. There’s smoked salmon, trout, tuna steak and halibut; chia seed concoctions with yoghurt and fruit; fresh fruit and nuts and cereal and someone who’ll make you whatever vegetable or fruit smoothie you want; fresh meats and cheese; freshly squeezed fruit juices; a selection of loose leaf tea; salads and olives and breadsticks. And to top it off, complimentary bubbly – pink and champagne.

Then alongside this you could also order from a menu, and we’d regularly ask for eggs florentine, which was served to perfection: just the right amount of hollandaise, always oozing yolks, and tasty spinach.

### A buffet for Conway

This was also magical for a weaning baby. We could pick and choose all sorts of things to offer him. From breadsticks to chew on, to slices of vegetable, to cottage and cream cheese on crackers, to raspberry and yoghurt deserts, to hard boiled eggs and slices of watermelon. We’d also get a smoothie made for him, to spoon feed, we put in a couple of nuts to introduce him to them in a small dose.

He tried the lot, most went on him, or the floor, or somewhere in between, and as holidaying parents we revelled in not having to tidy everything up at the end.

Breakfast was our staple meal, and we’d hang around in comfort for a good hour. When we left our table it looked like a bomb site, Conway’s little metal spoons scattered across the floor, tainted with yoghurt or whatnot, napkins covered in food.

## Days by the pool

Hotel Bellevue has four pools; a large one with an infinity ledge which pours down as a waterfall into a lower one. In the corner there’s a baby pool which is warmer, often in shade, and has water jets like a giant jacuzzi. There’s a large indoor pool too, which is very warm and perfect for Conway. They’re all saltwater.

We dressed our son in his regular swimming outfit, a red swimming nappy and blue whale shorts, and the family went swimming together. We did the things from his Little Dippers swimming lessons – floating, kicking, singing, and Conway enjoyed it all, though he had to get used to the water being salty, and he wasn’t happy about saltwater in your eyes, but then who is.

Post-swimming and lunch, Conway was tired,   I enjoyed some cuddles with him in the bar, lounging on a great brown sofa, Conway straddled across me fast asleep. Samantha had some time to herself by the pool. Each guest that passed me showed their own expression of “Awww, so cute”.

## Picnic on the balcony

After swimming and family nap time we took a stroll along the sea front, and onwards down a little path into town where we sought out Lidl for supplies.

From the hill the view of Mali Losinj was picturesque – its prominent church spire sat against distant thunderclouds, all bathed in beautiful red light from the low sun. One of those images that’s ingrained in our minds, for we didn’t bring the camera to the supermarket.

With a 7l bottle of water (the hotel water is expensive), Camembert, fresh meat, and some cheap bubbly, we returned to our room and set about having a picnic on our balcony.

In low light, the sea out beyond the pine trees, and with the muted noise of guests enjoying the night time, we enjoyed our cheap dinner without needing to worry too much about Conway and table service.

We discovered too that there are mosquitoes here, Conway evaded them all for the entirety of our trip, but by the end Samantha and I were a bit bitten and itchy all over. We were happy to pay this price for some twilight tranquility.

## Starry night

The skies around Mali Losinj are largely free from light pollution, and with clear skies, I had a rare opportunity to try out my astrophotography gear. I needed to practice with my gear and prepare for an astrophotography workshop I’d be running in August; what better place to do it.

At the water’s edge, on a concrete platform I set up the polar aligned sky tracker, tripod and camera, and aimed it at the sky.

The night was alive with the flashes of distant lightning while I struggled to find targets for my composition. When the wind picked up and it looked like storms might be headed our way, I called it a night.

---

## Morning walk

As at home, Conway woke early, at 6am his smiles and giggles said he was ready for the day and would not be going back to sleep any time soon. Samantha, who’d been feeding him in the night was the distinct opposite.

I took Conway out for a morning stroll in the already warm morning sunshine. Around the hotel an army of cleaners prepared the rooms for the day; outside men with leaf blowers cleared the paths of fallen pine needles.

Birds sang their morning songs; the pine trees were alive with the sound of blackbirds – Conway looked around to see if he could find the source of this twittering. In one tree a pied crow fought with an unidentified assailant, no doubt defending its nest, when all was settled it made a peculiar bubbly song, like an oriole perhaps.

By 8am the world was waking up, and we all had breakfast – Conway paid close attention to the blackbirds that visited us at our table, where they nibbled on the fallen breadsticks. He smiled at the other children too, enamoured by them and everything they did, cream cheese spread across his face – and somehow, up over his eyebrow and behind his ear.

## Afternoon in town

We avoided setting ourselves any hard to attain daily aims; most days we found that we’d only just finished breakfast by lunch time, and that we still needed some sort of nap.

Today we tried for an afternoon in town, namesake of the island. There’s a path from the hotel, through the pine forest, over a hill to the other side of the bay where you can walk or cycle along to town. From the top of the hill and down, we felt the strong northerly wind. If we weren’t from England you could say that it was chilly in the wind in the shade.

The paths look like they’re pedestrianised, but every now and then, and always by surprise, a moped or car drives by.

Today was the first day of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, and the town was alive with the sound of live football on big TVs, cheering fans and beer bottles. Russia were playing their opening game against Saudi Arabia while we perused the shops and restaurants. Butterflies and moths alike clambered amongst the live sport, sunshine and salty breeze.

We settled on pizza and beer at Bocca Vera, where we watched the boats bob in the harbour. When Conway wasn’t asleep he made eyes at the nearby family, an unbroken gaze directed towards their child, and a wide smile when they cooed back.

## Live music

Back at the hotel we enjoyed an evening on the sofas in the bar. We were brought Hugo and Caipirinha cocktails – the former – a light and sparkling mix of wine, elderflower and mint, the latter a perfect classic with a kick.

Besides us some local entertainment played their repertoire. Live lounge music, guitar, occasional and moderated accordion, and french lyrics. Conway watched on in delight, mouth agape, his first experience of live music. When the chorus returned he raised his arms in sheer joy.

---

We began to fall into a routine for breakfast; sit on the terrace, order some coffee, food found in shifts, we took turns choosing things for Conway.

The cool ambience of the morning, just the right temperature in the shade, was met with songs of blackbirds, and Conway spied on them wherever he’d spot them. Great seagulls also patrol the tables, circling high above nonchalantly, until someone goes away and leaves a plate of food unguarded. Someone brought out their heaped plate of breakfast, then returned inside presumably for a drink – an opportunistic seagull swooped in and proceeded to swallow as much of that food as possible – bread and vegetables and all going down whole, until a waitress shooed it away. The guy returned to scenes of a bird food fight.

After such a big breakfast there wasn’t much else to do but sit by the sea and relax. The waves were gentle as they lapped the shore, I put some music on and we made ourselves comfortable on the sofas beneath a parasol. We had ice cream and smoothies brought to us.

Then of course we had the obligatory family nap time, wherein we sleep and cool down in the comfort of air-con. Accomplishments for the day were a short trip to Lidl to get water and picnic supplies while Sam got a portion of chips from the seaside bar.

## Dinner at Rosemary

On our meanderings we’d seen a big sign, “Restaurant Rosemary” it said, hanging over a driveway. No menu or restaurant in sight, it looked a little odd – you need to walk through a couple of gardens and past some holiday villas to reach it. We called ahead to book a table and to check they had baby seats.

The restaurant sits neatly on a terrace overlooking a Mediterranean garden. Butterflies flit amidst olive trees and pink oleander overhang the tables. The low sun dappled it all with a warm evening light.

Our softly spoken waiter showed us to a table with baby seat, and he brought out a set of shiny spoons for Conway to play with. It was quiet, and we’d arrived before most other diners. While we thumbed the menu choosing what to eat, Conway nibbled on the pages, before being distracted by something shiny. He was well behaved all evening, and with his rice cakes and crackers he was satisfied until he became sleepy and fell asleep on Sam’s lap.

We thought the tasting menu would take too long for us, so ordered a selection of dishes to share instead:

* truffles and homemade pasta
* fish carpaccio,
* yoghurt and lamb,
* prawn pasta
* tiramisu
* soufflé

The pasta dishes were sublime, the thick homemade pasta infused with truffles for one, and a rich seafood flavour for the other. This rich creaminess complimented our refreshing fish and lamb choices. And we left space for quite excellent homemade desserts.

The whole experience was quaint and magical, a little secret garden-esque. A perfect evening out with baby.

With Conway wrapped up asleep in Samantha’s cardigan, we casually strolled home in the twilight, stars shining above the pine.

---

Conway was awake in the night, screaming at the top of his lungs at 2am. We’re thankful we brought some Calpol, it was hot in the room but we think it was teething.

Today we made a change for breakfast and opted to sit in the garden courtyard. For breakfast we asked to get Conway a smoothie, which included cashews and walnuts, Conway’s first sample of nuts. We ended breakfast with two glasses of pink bubbly which we took out to the terrace to enjoy. It was romantic bar the seagulls circling above us that kept dropping bits of croissant our way; I’ve never known it to rain french pastries before.

The hotel was in full preparation mode for a wedding; the platforms beside the sea were set up for the ceremony and drinks, and a room close to the terrace was made up for the wedding breakfast. Near the front entrance the salon was commandeered by a florist, the room was filled with all the cuttings and petals that didn’t make it.

## Walking North along the coast

We escaped the bride and groom and took our buggy North along the gravel path that hugs the coast.

Today was the weekend, and local families filled every pocket of beach. The water polo pools hosted competing teams, and fans cheered from benches. The referees whistle pierced the air. We spotted a large corvid hopping about the treetops.

In the hot afternoon sun we lathered ourselves and Conway in factor 50 sun lotion. I held a big glob ready for his nose, but an unexpected head bob and the glob was in his eye. Cue one of us holding Conway’s head while the other tries to wash out the cream with water, obviously he wasn’t best pleased about this.

We pushed on along the coast. To our left the sea hugged rocks, little rock pools formed and bathers found the few flat bits to unroll their towels and dry off. On our right the pine forest continued, small shrubs peaked out from a bed of pine. Where the sun slipped through the canopy its rays caught a hundred moths and butterflies, little dust trails could be seen following the bright bobbing dots.

Around the peninsula there’s a holiday camp with comfortable looking chalets. We stopped at KredoBar for pizza and Pepsi. There was that pleasant sound of children enjoying summertime as they squealed and splashed in the sea with their inflatable toys.

## Meat and football

After walking back, the return route is always fasted than the outward one, we went to Buffet Trojka for dinner. Sitting besides a football training pitch and some tennis courts, it specialises in meat cooked with fire. We ordered pork and lamb and two big tankards of Ožujsko – often the only Croat beer available.

The platter was huge; Sam picked meat from the bones while I fed slithers to Conway on my lap. We asked for the bill and they brought us another beer – the first time in all our travels that the universal sign for the bill (that hand gesture where you pretend to scribble on your hand) has been misinterpreted.

At the beach bar the locals gathered for Croatia’s opening game of the World Cup; Croatia vs Nigeria. We considered joining them to partake in the party atmosphere. In their red and white checked sports jerseys they chanted raucously, the Croatian football anthem played loudly and one madman ran around with a canister of red smoke. Perhaps too noisy for a sleepy baby, we retreated to the sea – where the water was calm and earth’s shadow was rising.

---

Today was my first Father’s day, and at breakfast Samantha surprised me with a card and some photo prints of me and Conway. We were in the garden again, and while we enjoyed all the juices and good loose leaf tea, we chatted with a local rich couple who come here for breakfast because ‘it’s cheaper’. They showed us a list of all the interesting things we could do on the island, a list of things we wouldn’t do.

After salmon and eggs we took another walk along the coast, this time turning left and going South. The paved walkway, with its built in lights, becomes a gravel track that hugs the coast. A small church, Crkvica Navještenja Blažene Djevice Marije, looks out into the bay, and just beyond is Lanterna, a restaurant and grill.

We pushed onwards in the 30C heat, seeking shade where the pine offered it, and using a little battery powered fan to keep Conway cool.

We stopped at Hotel Aurora for cola and ice cream. Two kids drove around a toy car with glee, reversing into trees and giggling with every bump, Conway watched them and showed his wide beam grin that woos all that meet him.

On the return trip we stopped to eat at Lanterna. Beneath the shade of a parasol and with the endless sea stretching out in front of us, we shared an octopus salad, flat bread and duved rice. Conway played with the little plastic packets the cutlery arrived in, crushing them in his tiny hands and staring intently with his mother’s concentration face.

After we’d fed, and after he’d fed, he slept in the buggy. We moved on and parked up at a bench in the shade besides the water. With Hotel Bellevue in the distance and the water gently rippling in a cooling breeze, we rested, soaking up all the tranquility on offer.

Back at the hotel we chilled besides the sea. A darter bird perched nearby and pruned its wings. Sam went for a dip in the clear water, you could see down to the bottom, through shoals of little fish.

## 5 course tasting menu at Alhambra

For the most expensive and tastiest holiday meal we’d booked dinner at the Alfred Keller restaurant, which is part of the boutique Alhambra hotel. We’d fancied staying there, but they didn’t have a pool and we found there were too many steps as well.

We dressed up smartly, and put Conway in a neat bird shirt. On arrival another baby was eating with a family, which relaxed us. We sat on the veranda overlooking the sea, the late afternoon sunshine lit up the pine forest besides us. Conway sat at the end of the table in his baby seat, the waiter brought him a selection of fine silver spoons for him to suck on and play with, with backups for when inevitably one would end up on the floor.

We kept our alcohol intake minimal, and instead of wine we celebrated with an opening Kir Royale aperitif, our go-to celebratory drink, which we drank slowly through the opening courses.

This was a restaurant of utmost quality; meals were brought out together and revealed to us in synchrony, with little pots of sauce poured onto whichever course was in front of us.

Our food was spectacular. The prawns and carrot was divine – I didn’t know you could make carrot taste so good. The fennel served with the monkfish was perfectly delicate. And the cauliflower cooked in brown butter and served with the striploin was another example of a common vegetable tasting otherworldly.

Simply superb.

As the sun set, the pine forest turned from orange to red to blue, the stars rose above us, and the moon and Venus were above our table. A singer and pianist played lounge tunes, and we sat a little longer to enjoy the privilege of this decadence, as Conway nodded off in our arms.

* Amuse Bouche (raspberry on mackerel)
* Zucchini cream soup, Adriatic shrimp, saffron mousse
* Carrot and Adriatic shrimp
* Monkfish fillet, broad bean, fennel, fish jus with smoked mussels
* Striploin, potato purée, ‘cabbage from green egg’, cauliflower with brown butter
* Complimentary cheese course and palette cleanser
* Beetroot and chocolate
* Petit four (mini doughnut, mini lemon meringue pie, mini tea cake on a stick)

---

After Father’s day, today we made space for some mummy time. After a long breakfast that included a rare double espresso, Samantha went to the spa for a massage while I took Conway to our room to rest and play. Our room smelt of orange and sandalwood. After her spa Sam relaxed by the pool with her book, I brought her forest fruit and vanilla ice cream from the seafront.

Tonight was England’s first match in the World Cup and we considered hanging out at the beach bar to enjoy it, but after what Sam described as “the worst burger ever”, we left and sat down by the sea instead, where the hotel’s jellyfish lights bobbed on the surface.

On the sofas by the water we noticed why Conway had been in such agony in the night – on his lower gum a little white tooth was poking out, he’d cut his first tooth on holiday.

When the sun had set it was time for kick-off and in the hotel’s Gentleman’s club (apparently football is only for men), I watched England win their first game, right at the death, beating Tunisia 2-1.

After Conway and Sam were asleep I went out to the water’s edge, where the light pollution was lowest, and tried my hand at a little more astrophotography – capturing my first photos of the lagoon and trifid nebulae.

---

We were up and out early this morning along with many others in the hotel after a fire alarm beckoned at 6am. Apparently something was burning in the kitchen but there was no cause for alarm. With so little sleep for all of us this was the hardest breakfast, and neither of us coped well with the sleep deprivation. The coffee didn’t do it, and after our regular morning feast we all went back to bed, not stirring again until the afternoon. It’s nice having no pressure to do anything, and it’s lovely to sleep when you need it.

Today was also the hottest, in Croatia’s summer heatwave the temperatures nudged above 30C, and the sky stayed ever blue. Lathered in sun lotion and donning sunglasses and hats, with Conway in the baby carrier, we walked beneath the pines along the coast to Lanterna for a mid-afternoon lunch. Under a parasol we looked out to sea, where a police boat passed in front of a distant island.

We couldn’t leave Croatia without having some ćevapčići – a type of skinless grilled sausage, with a side of duved rice. The starter of anchovies and prawn, and the squid salad were washed down with cold beer.

## Vela Straza

There’s an old fort that looks out over Mali Losinj, and we were reliably informed you could probably walk up there with a buggy. It’s about half an hour from the hotel.

We packed a bag of fruit, salami, bread, cheese and Pringles and set-off for a sunset picnic at the top – hoping for some fabulous views.

The upward path was a layer of loose stone, thin at times, it snaked left and right and our buggy kicked and rocked as we tried to force it up the hill. We put Conway in the carrier and Sam marched on ahead while I carried all the bags and struggled with the three-wheeled city stroller. “Yes, I’m fine”.

Eventually the path evened out and turned to gravel and the last stretch up to the top was easy. We parked the buggy by the fort and found a bench with views out to the horizon for our picnic.

Four Germans joined us at the summit, they attached GoPros to trees and recorded time lapse videos of the sun falling into the sea.

The clear blue skies offered no dramatic sunset, and the distant cloud covered mountains were too far away to dazzle us. Down in the bay we saw Mali Losinj light up for the evening.

The journey back was easy, and we stopped in the hotel bar to listen to some live piano before going to sleep.

---

We were on to our last full day in Mali Losinj, so we ordered minute steak for breakfast. We’d seen it on the menu a few times but had always preferred eggs until now.

All morning we relaxed by the swimming pools, we took Conway into the tiny pool with jets, and then the big indoor pool. With all the swimming and water we tired him out, he slept for half the morning giving us adults time to swim, read and relax. I managed to read a whole chapter of my book – Commander Hadfield’s biography. We had a giant tuna steak sandwich for lunch, and in the coffee we had a little DOM Benedictine added.

Packing with all our baby stuff is a day’s activity in and of itself. And this is where Samantha excels. While she packed all the things into vacuum zip lock backs I carried Conway on one last tour of the hotel, walking to all the bits we hadn’t seen yet – or more precisely, being a bit nosey and looking at the suites on the 4th floor.

For dinner we’d considered at last trying the hotel’s evening restaurant. We’d avoided it so far because 5 courses is a lot with a baby, and so were the prices. But tonight we wanted something easy, and had burgers by the pool, foregoing our last opportunity. The reviews said it was overpriced and average anyway (though I do doubt that a little). Sat on little wooden tables beneath the pines, we ate our burgers and drank dark beer and mocktails as the sun went down. Conway sat in his stokke high chair and made a mess of cream cheese and crackers on the floor before devouring the wedge of grapefruit that came with Sam’s drink.

For the last time we sat on the sofas by the water’s edge and watched the sun go down, the clouds suggested the sunset might be a little more dramatic, so we recorded video and took photos, but the red cloud merely glimmered before it grew dark and the jellyfish lights turned on.

For one last hurrah, we sat outside in the warm night by the bar to have one more fabulous cocktail each. Rather than going for the classics we know and love – which we knew were made to perfection here – we tried something new. Samantha has a tip here, which she learnt from her cocktail; avoid any cocktail that has watermelon liqueur, unless you want a drink that tastes sweet and sticky like some bad alcopop from the 90s. Suffice to say, Sam wasn’t a fan of her choice. Meanwhile I had the “Happy Afternoon”, a touch of absinthe, sparkling white wine and passion fruit, served in a champagne flute – this was magical and did indeed make me happy.

---

And now our adventure, perhaps we can’t call this one an adventure, maybe more an extravagance, was coming to an end and it was time to go home.

We finished packing at 6am, had an early breakfast feast one last time then jumped into our minibus transfer back to Pula. Thankfully Conway slept for much of the return trip, and was awake to enjoy the ferry transfer.

We flew from Pula back to Gatwick and EasyJet were good to us again, they moved our seats and put us in a row to ourselves, giving us space for all the baby things. Conway was overexcited for the entire flight, chatting loudly to himself and anyone who might listen, “da da da da, na na na, aaaah, ah, ah, ah”, he said, over and over, with the odd high-pitched squeal of delight in between, bouncing on our legs, reaching to grab and crumple the paper ads stuck to the back of chairs.

We arrived home to a glorious English summer unlike any we’ve seen for years. The blue skies persisted, and we eked our summer holiday vibes into the following days. England would go on to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, where they would lose out to Croatia. Clear blue skies and temperatures in the high 20s carried on, unabashed, from June through to August.
