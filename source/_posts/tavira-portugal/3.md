## Rain, rain, rain

Thursday was a washout. We seem to have this effect on sunny places; in Malaga it rained when we visited – weeks of clear skies and sunshine turned to heavy rain when we arrived. It seems the same is happening in Tavira. The skies were grey and all day a fine drizzle fell.

Everything in the Algarve is set up for outdoors. Restaurants have outdoor seating, things to see and do are all outside. So for half the day we relaxed in the hotel, we gave Conway free roam of the restaurant area, and in our room he entertained himself with his pink and purple ball – just small enough to roll under the bed, whenever it was out of reach he’d spread eagle on the tiles and try to spot it, it was the cutest thing.

We filled our hotel room with music from my phone. Conway loves to dance, I put on Michael Jackson and let him bob and shake his bum with glee, there was even a little bit of foot movement.

We couldn’t keep baby cooped up all day, we asked staff about what indoor things there were to do. Any soft play areas? They suggested the shopping centre, we drove there in the rain. The most exciting bit was navigating the tight concrete ramps for the multi-storey car park. We found one suitable soft play – a little slide – it’d do. We did some supermarket shopping, but all the fancy looking cheese and meat we bought was pretty much tasteless.

## Night time in Tavira

By dinner time the weather was clearing. The river in Tavira was still at sunset, and the distant towering rain clouds shone red. We stopped for photos.

For dinner Samantha stumbled on a fine pizzeria, Luzzo. It was new, and it used electronic tablets for their menus. The pizzas were delicious, and we introduced Conway to his first cheesy-tomato bread – he couldn’t get enough.
