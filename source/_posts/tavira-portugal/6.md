## Exploring Tavira – part 2

After a good night’s sleep, Conway didn’t wake us until 8am, we zipped out early for breakfast. Over the weekend our quiet hotel had filled up, and there’s not quite enough seats and tables for everyone. And we wouldn’t want to miss out on those egg tarts.

We were blessed with bright sunshine again, so this morning we returned to Tavira to explore the parts of town we hadn’t yet seen. We ditched the buggy and took Conway in a baby carrier around town – it was liberating – no longer did cobbles and raised curbs thwart us.

We climbed the steep hill to the castle. In hindsight a Sunday morning wasn’t the best time to go and see all the sights –the churches were busy, and the camera obscura was closed.

In a local bakery we rested with bread and cake – a TV showed a story about squirrel conservation, at a table well dressed mormons chatted following their morning service.

We looped up and around the town, crossed the river and found Luzzo again, a takeaway pizza for lunch eaten on a bench amidst some shrubbery and trees in Jardim da Alagoa, and one hummingbird hawk moth (one of my favourite creatures in all the world), that I tried but failed to photograph.

For the rest of the day we stayed at our hotel, sleeping, drinking non-alcoholic beer by the pool, or reading. The restaurant was full with a christening, mum dressed in white like a bride – we’d guessed it was a wedding.

At the hotel restaurant I had roasted octopus, my third octopus of the trip, and Sam had a monkfish and rice stew. Conway was well behaved throughout, if only because an old British couple on a tour of Europe kept him entertained.
