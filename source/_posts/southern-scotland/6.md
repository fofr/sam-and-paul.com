## Last day in Scotland

Today was our last day in Scotland. The weather forecast told us there’d be a clear and cool night and low winds; that means mist and reflections. Up an hour before dawn, we headed to Clatteringshaws reservoir once again.

Arriving under darkness, the place was still; a solitary tent was pitched on the beach, the water was still and reflecting, and small plumes of mist were rolling around its surface. Perfect.

We stayed here for hours, taking pictures from our tripods, watching the sunrise, seeing the fog build in the distant valleys, and enjoying the dancing displays of the early morning swifts on the water. Just being here was magical, and for a while we stopped to take it all in.

We were back at Airds for 9am and a welcomed fried breakfast before checking out. We weren’t in a rush to get anywhere, we’d soon be heading down South to the Lake District. But for the time being the sun was out, the skies were clear and it was perfect weather for sitting in the garden at Airds and watching the songbirds and red kites. With the occasional cup of tea we did a whole lot of nothing.

## Caerlaverlock Castle

On the way out of Scotland lies the triangular shaped [Caerlaverlock Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerlaverock_Castle). Built in the 13th century, it’s fairly small and it wasn’t worth paying for entry. Sat opposite we had some tasty and cheap lunch from the cafe before heading on our way again.

And then it was time to leave Scotland again, for the second time this year we left without trying any whisky. And for the second time we’d fallen in love with the vast wonder that is wild Scotland.

On the horizon, rising up from the Caerlaverlock nature reserve, we could see our next destination. The Lake District.
