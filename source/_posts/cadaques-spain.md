From Brighton Station and the usual decrepit First Capital Connect trains, then Gatwick Airport and proficient EasyJet flight to Barcelona, then taxi to Estacio del Nord, and a 2h45 Sarfa bus north, through winding pyrenean roads, down to the coastal town of Cadaques.

Cadaques just oozes serenity, waves wash against small beaches and coves, scooters whiz along the one-way beach roads whilst golden brown Spaniards light up and coolly puff their smoke into the air.

The town and cathedral sit pretty at the foot of towering mountains, the sun bakes the terracotta rooftops, whilst kids climb on the Dali statue in the centre. Open air restaurants secure the latest fishermen’s catch, and most menus include Paella.

Boats litter the bay, the wind clanging ropes against their metal masts, amongst the sound of kids sunbathing on jetties and French tourists’ camera shutters, snapping views of the cathedral Santa Maria.

We’re staying in Hotel Sol Ixent, a new build 20mins out of town. The “Gala” restaurant has photos of Dali and his wife, the reception dons art books and a piece by Joan Comella. The pool glistens turquoise, but a tip toe in reveals its true temperature. The room itself is stark, but for a painted canvas of crashing waves, and a TV that we wont turn on. Still, the shower is nice and big.

Lugging the suitcases across town was thirsty business and we gambled with the hotel restaurant on the first night. Sam had swotted up on some culture beforehand, and pre-meal she shared her knowledge, “We keep our cutlery for all courses and we have to pay for bread, water and olives”, “Most places serve Paella but few use Saffron”.

Our menu choices were conservative:
<div class="menu">

### Menu

<ul>
<li>Bread and olives</li>
<li>Beef escalope with wild mushrooms, butternut squash and hazelnut sauce</li>
<li>Pork with potato (it was really good).</li>
<ul>
</div>

Until now I hadn’t been particular to mushrooms, their slimy texture and shrink when you cook ‘em nature rarely appealed. These were different, they were wild, fresh, and I was addicted. (Addicted to ‘shrooms on the first day of the holiday? whatever next!)

Continental breakfast brought few surprises, and we gorged ourselves on croissants, cheese, meats, bread and Nespresso (no proper coffee to be seen). 

With back packs stuffed full of sun cream, towels, change of clothes and other heavy stuff Sam might need but probably won’t use, the whole of Cadaqués beckoned. The coastal walk from east to west revealed its treasures - dirt paths and rocky walkways, through cacti, to hidden beaches and rocky outcrops where you can sit and paddle, then around to the old town and the gorgeous views on approach.

The back roads are thin and labyrinthine, similar to [Molyvos](http://www.sam-and-paul.com/2008/09/two-weeks-in-molyvos-in-lesbos-greece/), and its apparent why scooters are popular. Purple vines grow up the whitewashed walls towards the deep blue sky above.

For a cheap lunch we had the €12 set menu at Es Taronger, including wine.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Gazpacho
*   Moules
*   Salmon and chips
*   Ice cream
</div>

All that walking was sweat inducing, and an ice cold pool soon put sort to that.

In our evening dress, we passed a huge mechanical dragon, being slayed by a conquistador (as you do!) - a converted car with built in fireworks.

In the high ceiling’d and overly lit Restaurant, es Baluard, recommended by the Lonely Planet, we settled with white wine for the evening.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Bread and olives
*   Spider crab and octopus paella (shared)
*   Profiteroles with hot chocolate sauce
*   “Bescuit” ice cream with hot chocolate sauce
</div>

Digging into the spider crab paella with industrial strength pliers, we spent an hour stabbing and scraping at the tastiest bits, hidden deep inside the legs. Sam only hit the wall with flying crab shards the once, the rest landed on my plate. Whilst the crab was tasty, we didn’t eat it fast enough and the rice was soon cold. The rich hot chocolaty desserts were fantastic.

The pool is even colder in the mornings, and that’s when we decided to have our next dip. The house-martins flit about, occasionally diving towards the pool for a quick drink. Catching this on camera is surprisingly tough - usually resulting in a blur and a splash. I gained a new respect for nature photographers.

In town again, we ate tapas at Nord Est, a smart looking blue bar in the east of the town. 

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Roasted aubergine, olives and onion on toast
*   Potato omelette/tortilla with bread and tomato spread
</div>

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-46.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-46.jpg)

Passing the placards of Dali’s paintings, pointing out the landmarks (often amongst melting clocks), we walked across the town to the west side of the bay, with yet more beaches and secret hideaways.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-47.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-47.jpg)

At the far-end there is a small island with an old concrete bridge, the gate was marked as private but that was largely ignored. The cow-paths took us to the rocky summit, where we carved out a place to sleep, snack and read, sharing chapter five of “One day”, whilst tour boats chugged past below. The king of the mountain bliss, with all its calming soundscapes, could only be interrupted by the occasional sharp stone digging into our backs, as we shuffled to get more comfortable.

The Spanish eat late, and our 8:30pm reservation at Can Tito gave us the best choice of tables. I sat facing the night sky, and Sam sat with a view of the kitchen, eagerly watching the chef prepare food.

With each dish that passed us, Sam’s face lit up with an “Oooh” expression. Failing to translate the specials, we asked the chirpiest-busiest Spanish waitress for help. These were our choices:

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Bread and olives
*   Endives with Roquefort (lovely olive oil)
*   Pelaia fish for 2 with potatoes and tomatoes
*   Mouthfuls of Arroz Negro
*   Raspberry cheesecake
</div>

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-56.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-56.jpg)

The food was divine, and as we jointly filleted the Pelaia, Sam struck up some banter with our French neighbours on the table next to ours. Soon we were trying mouthfuls of their very tasty Arroz Negro, “c’est particular”. Delicious.

As many of you know, Sam and I are somewhat fanatical about cheesecake. Tonight’s freshly made raspberry one was unlike any other and one of the tastiest we’ve ever had.

Making a great evening only better, we enjoyed the coincidence of discovering the head waitress plans to study English in Brighton.

After breakfast and the escapade of finding Sam’s black cardigan we set out with picnic in tow, towards Port Lligat and Casa Dali--you need to book ahead, and our hotel receptionist grudgingly did so for us. An hour early, we trekked along the coastline until we could go no further, a rocky outcrop blocking our path.  Beneath us lay a beautiful secluded little cove, with a bit of sand and perfect paddling water.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-66.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-66.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-63.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-63.jpg)

The one time I didn’t have swimming shorts or suitable shoes we wanted to swim, and in my attempt to paddle I slipped on the mossy rock falling flat on my bum and soaking both shorts and underwear. Phone and wallet survived, miraculously untouched. “The rocks are slippy”, Sam warned, clothes already sopping. As I dried off, we dangled our toes in the cool sea and watched boats head out with their diving parties.

Back at Dali’s house, ticket in hand, we explored the crazy yet ingenious rooms that the surrealist once lived in. A polar bear with rifle greats you at the entrance, stuffed swans fly above the dining area and everything is not quite normal. Little cages poke out from the wall--no longer chirping with locusts, whilst mirrors cleverly manipulate the light. The workshop houses unfinished pieces, and the red oboe room has perfect acoustics. Gala’s collection of photos and magazines still cover a cupboarded room, whilst their separate beds lie made in the bedroom. As crazy and outlandish as this famous house is, it’s real, there are no placards explaining things; attention has been paid to keep this place as close to how it was as possible.

Outside the weirdness continues, as we explore the areas where Dali entertained his guests. An outdoor dining area complete with rhino head, a giant egg on a room with cemented and broken piano, a tyre themed swimming pool with reclining Michelin men, and an old telephone box in the corner. Through the strangeness, titbits of his genius appear, and we grasp a fraction of his overwhelming fascination in everything.

Picnic time! At the top of the hill, we sliced our saucisson, smeared president cheese over baguette and covered our fingers in melted chocolate from dip pots.

That evening our food was all the more dignified, going back to Cadaqués and the recommended Casa Nun. A tiny two storey restaurant, we sat at the top, with a private open window looking onto the bay. Cadaqués’ sublime night-time soundscape set the atmosphere for our meal. We savoured the fresh black olives and De Casta Rose wine; ceiling fan spinning above us and cute 25th anniversary painting on the wall behind. 

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Tuna fish and mango carpaccio with parmesan
*   Sardines marinated in vermouth
*   Duck breast in port sauce with pear
*   Grilled small squid with green beans and carrots
*   Chocolate cheesecake
</div>

The mango and tuna carpaccio peculiarly worked wonderfully, and the salty fresh sardines were of course delicious. My duck breast and pear was perfect, both meaty, tender and sweet, I’m salivating at the thought of eating it again. Sam’s grilled squid came with tentacles et al, we made sure beforehand. And chocolate cheesecake is always a pleasure. 

Live music began to play outside, acoustic guitar, wafting through the window, we listened, and gazed at the bay. So carefree and gorgeous.

Our last day, and we explored the town’s backstreets, picking up a couple of souvenirs en route, getting lost and then finding ourselves near Port Lligat.

After an all too short and ill prepared dip in a secluded bay, we sought to find another place to enjoy the sea and sunbathe in private. Our first discovery, over some towering rocks and down to a concealed spot, had jagged stone, crashing waves and one too many sea anemones. We upped and headed north, back towards Dali’s house. Quite by accident, we stumbled on a perfect sandy beach, small rippling waves and no one in sight, views of Dali's house in the distance. 

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-123.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-123.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-128.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-128.jpg)

We swam out to sea, or in my case, walked as far as I could, swam a little bit, then turned back, struggling to cope with my red flip flops which sank into the sand beneath. Sam made her way out to the boats, and a small jetty. We enjoyed another infamous cheese and sausage picnic, using a perfectly placed rock as a table, sarong acting as tablecloth. All very civilised. I skimmed stones, Sam took pictures and we avoided a throbbing purple jellyfish.

For our last night in Cadaqués, we returned to our favourite eatery, Can Tito. On our way, we stopped for pictures together at all the scenic points.

The town was busy tonight, with a triathlon taking place and all the weekend visitors arriving, the restaurant was busy too, though we’d already planned what we were ordering:

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Anchovies
*   Squid ink croquettes
*   Paella for 2
*   Raspberry cheesecake
</div>

Sat in the same seats as before, we again enjoyed wonderful food. The squid croquettes were a perfect bite-sized sample of the Arroz Negro flavour and the paella balanced sea food and rice excellently. Sam thanked the chef personally, and we rounded off our evening with another heavenly cheesecake.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-142.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-142.jpg)

For the last time, slightly drunk again, we walked back along the coast, past the tall pink house, past the kids up late having parties and the romantically entwined couples, the bayside cafes, the jetties and rocking boats with weird statue on the corner (not a Dali), through the unlit roads using my iPhone as a torch, under the milky way, bats looping around street lights, to the hotel. Up the stairs, along the echoing tiled hallway, to our room.
