Travel day, we were heading to Hue (pronounced "who-A") from [Hoi An](/2012/12/hoi-an-vietnam/), and I was in travel mode. What does that mean? Well, my body basically shuts down and refuses to handle food or liquids until my subconscious is suitably calmed or distracted. I was clearly worried about getting to Hue, despite knowing we had our taxi booked, our luggage ready and our train tickets in hand.

I left Sam to her own devices, she cycled into town to pick up her made to measure clothes. A dress (or two), a couple of tops, some shorts, some trousers and something secret she doesn't want me to know about. What did I do? A bit of packing, a bit of sleeping, not a lot really. I ran to breakfast and caught the last of the food as they were packing up.

Soon enough it was time to go, a 40 minute taxi ride to Da Nang, a little too hot for comfort, to the train station. Tickets in hand, backpacks slumped on metal seats, we waited an hour or so for the delayed SE4 train to take us north. Outside a large, very cool looking, black train sat upon a pedestal, marked with the golden star on a red circle, sitting beneath the Vietnam and communist flags.

We were in the front carriage of our train, soft seats with air conditioning and a television that played Vietnamese comedy. The train followed the Hai Van peninsula north, along the gorgeous coastline.

The twelve train carriages snaked left and right, up and down the mountainside. Da Nang appearing against the coastline every now and then, the odd tunnel plunging us into darkness.

The trip took a couple of hours, and the train moved rather slowly. But the scenery more than made up for that.

At Hue our four minute walk to our hotel, La Residence, was thwarted by a bridge no longer existing. From the looks of things it had fallen into the river and was being rebuilt. This confused us, and we walked, laden with backpacks and all that heavy newly bought clothing, a short way in the wrong direction.

Passing locals with our backpacks, we were greeted with smiles, the occasional laugh and more often than not a look of bemusement. A taxi driver offered to help, but we knew it wouldn't be far, and we continued onwards, in the 35C evening heat. Sure enough the hotel was just around the corner, our own little diversion completed. We stumbled into the five star luxury hotel sweaty and panting. “Can we check in please?”

Our room was a little smaller than before, and the wifi a little patchy, but we had a balcony overlooking Perfume River, and at twilight it really was quite beautiful. The enormous flag tower stands proudly in the distance, marking the entrance to both the citadel and the imperial city.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Our room at La Residence](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-307.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-307.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Our room at La Residence</figcaption></figure>

Too exhausted to venture out into the heat, we chose to eat at the hotel's rather excellent restaurant, Le Parfum. We sat outside and listened to the crickets and frogs play their tunes.

With some white wine and a Festival beer, we enjoyed the four elements of Hue starter, while trying to avoid any Mosquitoes. The starters was comprised of Fire: scrambled egg, scallop and Minh Mang; Earth: Grilled chicken stuffed with truffle; Wind: Green papaya with ginger salad and deep fried rice coated prawns and Water: Exotic fruits gazpacho, mango sorbet and pesto. Yumm-eeee.

And our mains were simply scrumptious too. Pan Fried Mahi Mahi crusted with Vietnamese coffee, chocolate and local spices, with turmeric rice, asia pear salad and spicy lemongrass rougail and garlic emulsion. Grilled calamari with Vietnamese satay and lemongrass, pineapple fried rice, shrimp and sautéed pak choi with garlic. Delicious.

And for dessert, a little risky, Durian ice cream with papaya fruit and star anise. It was sort of like a Vietnamese rhubarb crumble.

La Residence is a luxurious place to stay, and the breakfast platter was no exception. A huge range of fruits, yoghurt, and a charming Irish chef that'll prepare eggs however you want. Probably the best selection of all the hotels we stayed at. It's all very decadent, and colonial.

Sam's book, “Over the moat”, is set in Hue, and she already knows a lot about the place. We had a quiet morning, and at 11ish we ambled out of the hotel to explore Hue. It was already very hot, temperatures were in the mid thirties. Outside, a couple of tuk-tuk drivers waited at the front gate, hassling everyone for business. We smiled and walked away, down to Perfume river (Song Huong).

At the river's edge we walked towards town. Swan boats were moored, tied up and unused in the quieter rainy season. The river was quiet, as were the well tended pretty gardens we walked through, with their artistic and obscure sculptures. The distant towering flag pole, the symbol of Hue more than anything else, grew closer.

We reached the busy white Phu Xuan bridge and crossed the river. A motorcycle stopped and asked if we wanted a lift, there's always someone on the lookout for business, we politely declined. The roads were thriving, and motorbikes streamed past, each rider with their dainty thin as an egg shell helmet, occasionally on their arm rather than their head.

At the end of the bridge the huge 37m flag pole towered above us. We walked left, down another busy road, over a moat, through the Quang Duc gate and into the citadel, a walled city that is the heart of Hue.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Hue](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-311.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-311.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Hue's enormous flag pole</figcaption></figure>

At the gate there are five cannons, representing the five elements, and at the opposite gate, Ngan, there are four, for the four seasons. We studied them, mainly as means of staying in the shade. Then, in the heat once more, we strolled in front of the imperial enclosure, along another moat. This is a fortified citadel within a citadel, and its entrance is behind the flag pole, you just have to walk the long way round to get there.

We entered through the grand Ngo Mon gate, with its billowing red Vietnamese flags. Though visitors enter through a side gate, the main opening is reserved for emperors, of which today there are none.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Ngo Mon Gate, Entrance to the imperial enclosure](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-312.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-312.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Ngo Mon Gate, Entrance to the imperial enclosure</figcaption></figure>

This enclosure, and the citadel, were all built in 1802, when the then emperor, Gia Long, founded the Nguyen dynasty and the capital moved south from Hanoi to Hue. But of the 148 structures in the ornate enclosure, only 20 have survived the French and American wars, with much of the area obliterated right at the end of the American war.

The enclosure itself is enormous and we intended to spend most of the day here. Already roasting, sweaty, tired and hot, we were thankful every time the sun escaped behind a cloud, a little temporary shade never went amiss. It wasn't the right day to wear a tight black London 2012 t-shirt.

The gate leads directly onto the grand Thai Hoa palace, where photography is forbidden. It's a single large room, red and golden, an empty echoey chamber with red painted pillars and Chinese decorations. In the centre sits a throne, golden and raised higher than everything else, with ornate creature like feet.

Out the back a Samsung TV runs on a loop, showing a video which explains the layout of the enclosure, complete with 3D computer models showing how it all might have once looked, and functioned.

The palace opens out onto a courtyard; sitting pretty in the middle lies a great golden dragon, both menacing and bemused, and perhaps in need of a dentist, its teeth splayed out awkwardly. On either side were old imperial offices, now tourist shops and art galleries. One room let's you dress in traditional imperial clothes and have a photo taken, for a fee. The corridors and buildings immediately beyond are being renovated, many of them completely rebuilt, with new wooden pillars and roofing just going up.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![A bemused golden dragon](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-315.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-315.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">A bemused golden dragon</figcaption></figure>

From these new buildings we headed West, and found ourselves looking out into a grassy field where two elephants were roped up, waiting for someone to pay for a ride. The larger of the two was missing a tusk. A donkey and cart trotted by, the cart a red and golden affair. There wasn't anyone taking the ride, but given the size of this place it would probably be worthwhile. At a little hut, seemingly a restaurant, but without any food, we took pleasure in our fast melting ice lollies. Sam won a MacBook Pro, apparently.

We double backed and visited what once was the Forbidden City. Beyond the courtyard and an eight foot wall, where there would have been a royal enclosure, a citadel within a citadel within a citadel (this is all a bit Inception-like), the gateway instead opened to grassy mounds and ruins. It was all overgrown and waiting attention, all signs of any royalty were gone.

Only the galleries seemed to have survived, and much of that was newly built. Between them, and away from the sprawling grasses, some perfectly trimmed tortoise topiary has been added. Walking about the ruins, you find shards of ornate tile work, intricate decorations blown apart, scattered, amongst grass, or mud, or part buried.

We kept stopping in shade to rest. It was hard going and we were hungry. We stopped by the emperor's old reading room, then beneath some trees, then beneath some stands with cool tiled floors and a light breeze.

We stumbled onto the rebuilt Royal Theatre, a music and dance show was in mid swing, it looked good through the slit wooden panels as I sipped on my cold 7up. We decided to come back another day and watch the full show. Slightly beyond lay an area filled with scaffolding, and old building parts, marked with green numbers. Renovations in full flow.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Numbered items waiting for restoration](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-320.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-320.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Numbered items waiting for restoration</figcaption></figure>

4pm now, and we were desperate for some food. Despite the size of this place, all you could buy were ice creams, and a lowly packet of crisps. We searched high and low for more food, and kept uncovering huge parts of the enclosure we hadn't seen. Eventually, amidst the gorgeous To Mieu temple complex, which we realised we weren't taking in, we decided to head back. And come back another day to finish it all off. A giant spider, waiting in the dark, on the wall of a temple, helped us make that decision.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![To Mieu temple](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-323.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-323.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">To Mieu temple</figcaption></figure>

Stupidly, we walked all the way back too. And here the roads are much more difficult to cross. When crossing, find a local and use them as a shield, trust they know what they are doing. We still haven't got the hang of it yet and it still feels so remarkably dangerous. We took the main road back, going West, past the national school where Ho Chi Minh had studied, and the Ho Chi Minh museum next to our hotel.

Exhausted from the days trek, the heat and the sun, we took a dip in the very deep pool and ordered some poolside comfort food. Though the pool was too deep for me, the shallowest part two metres deep. And when I came to dry myself off, I found myself being bitten. My towel has been next to something sticky and had been covered in ants, now I was covered in ants and the ants weren't happy. Ants just bite you to hurt you. Our beer came, we moved to another table and I angrily ploughed into a large plate of special fried rice.

Up in our room the sun was setting, and twilight across the river and the pool was lovely. In the evening we really did relax. We sat in the bar with some cocktails, planning tomorrow, reading about some tours, writing about Hoi An and listening to the bar's chill out music (from a Spotify playlist no less).

Sam had been on Trip Advisor reading about the best things to do in and around Hue. The top rated attractions were the emperors's tombs outside of Hue, so we booked an overly expensive tour through our hotel, not wanting to hunt around all morning trying to find something else.

In the lobby, as an elderly Australian tour group were checking in to the hotel, we met our guide and driver. Hello! We climbed in to the back of a black air conditioned car and sped away, out of town towards the tomb of Khai Dinh, before it got too hot. We escaped the busy Hue streets, out into the countryside, climbing into the hills where the Vietnamese emperors have their resting place.

Khai Dinh's tomb is a mix of Vietnamese and French architecture. It's small but intricate, and took 11 years to build. The Emperor had visited France in the early twentieth century and brought back a certain style. The buildings are all blackened concrete, and almost gothic in appearance.

Getting out of the car, we faced three flights of stairs to the top. Immediately sweating in the heat, out guide shares some of his wet wipes, cleaning and cooling, a great idea. Our umbrellas were already acting as parasols.

Up the first flight of stairs, and we are in the Honour Courtyard, where lines of statues are placed, servants and armies to aid the emperor in his afterlife. Between the rows of statues lies a small building, inside, in Chinese scripture, it details how to build the mausoleum. Our guide explains the meanings the emperors gave to numbers, and the importance of colours, though most of that escapes me now.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Samantha and I, with a bearded stone man](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-328.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-328.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Samantha and I, with a bearded stone man</figcaption></figure>

We climb up two more flights of stairs, to the main building, Thien Dinh, and Khai Dinh's resting place. He died in 1925\. The outside is dark, concrete and gothic; but inside there's an explosion of colour, it is golden and beautiful. Sculptures of dragons climb the walls, old broken pottery is coerced into great depictions of the four seasons, with quaint cute little birds at every intersection. The back most room, where the tomb lies, is even more detailed, with deranged dragons circling the ceilings. And sitting in the centre, a life size golden statue of Khai Dinh himself, on his golden throne. Behind, a ruby blazoned sunrise.

The room to the far left is much more understated. A bronze statue of Khai Dinh as a leader, with hand on sword, sits near to a painting of him at his writing desk. Around the edges are antique European furniture, and cupboards filled with ancient crockery.

Stepping out of the tomb, the veranda opens up to a stunning view of the surrounding hills. In the distance, a towering modern white Buddha pokes his head out. We took our photos, though are guide never quite moved out of the way enough. His head or hand always slightly in the way.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![The view from Khai Dinh](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-334.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-334.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">The view from Khai Dinh's mausoleum, with Samantha (and our guide)</figcaption></figure>

Back down to the car, with its cooling air conditioning, we drove onwards to the second stop of the day, Minh Mang's mausoleum. And how radically different this was. A huge area, like a public garden, with a central hill, in which the emperor is buried, somewhere, with all his riches and relics. No one knows exactly where.

This mausoleum is much more traditional, in a sublime natural setting; trees, plants, gardens, lakes, a large park and forest. It's serene. The area was also planned to be used as a summer palace, with places for the emperor to relax, but Minh Mang never saw the place complete, he died too soon.

We entered through a side entrance (another main entrance reserved only for an emperor), into a baking open courtyard with dragon and lion statues. A direct path leads from the outer wall, through three complexes, each up and down stairs, to the hill and the emperor's resting place. We proceeded through decorated arches, paved promenades and red painted pavilions, each separated with lakes and gardens.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Minh Mang](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-340.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-340.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Minh Mang's mausoleum</figcaption></figure>

The Asian gardens were beautiful and relaxing, we could have spent all day here. Indeed, we spent a long time just sitting, watching the view, listening to the birds, and drinking cold drinks. Sat on an old red painted doorframe at the last of the pavilions, we looked out at a path which led over lotus filled ponds and beneath royal signage to the giant hill where the emperor lies and its locked gate. Above us, blue skies and fluffy white clouds.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Paul posing at Minh Mang](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-343.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-343.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Paul posing at Minh Mang's mausoleum (and our guide)</figcaption></figure>

Not really wanting to leave, we set off to meet our dragon boat, a garish sky blue boat with a yellow painted dragon's head. We left Minh Mang's tomb and set off up stream, back towards Hue, it took about an hour. It was a long, slow journey with not much to see. Men on boats churned the riverbed, collecting salt, or mud, or minerals, to sell. Cattle grazed by the river, and there were the occasional small villages by the water, with more moored boats than buildings. We passed a couple of other tourists along the way, and our driver tried to sell us goods, but when we showed no interest she put away the tourist tat.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![The blue dragon boat](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-345.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-345.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">The blue dragon boat</figcaption></figure>

We arrived at the Thien Mu pagoda which overlooks Perfume River. It's 21m high, octagonal and has seven storeys. Beyond the pagoda are a couple of humble active temples with practicing monks. Inside the temple we removed our shoes and watched as others paid their respects, burning incense before a giant Buddha statue.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--portrait">[![Thien Mu Pagoda](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-347.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-347.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Thien Mu Pagoda</figcaption></figure>

We also poked out heads into some of the monk's side buildings, where they were mostly having lunch. This place is known for housing the blue Austin Westminster car that the monk Thich Quang Duc took to Saigon before his famous self immolation.

At the back there's a lovely bonsai tree garden and a newly erected pagoda in memory of a recently passed senior monk. Through the fence at the very rear, in amongst all the pine trees, a huge graveyard can be seen, one of many out of town Vietnamese graves in the country.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--portrait">[![Samantha, doing a pose](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-348.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-348.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Samantha, doing a pose</figcaption></figure>

The boat took us directly back to the hotel, stopping at a jetty right next to it. In our room we ate fruit and snacks, rested and then headed out into town for dinner.

We took a taxi to the Tran Tien bridge and wandered around the park as we waited to grow hungry. A huge storm was brewing over the river. Despite this, the budding capitalist Vietnamese kept offering to sell us boat trips. I refused and gestured to the sky.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![A storm over Perfume River](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-350.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-350.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">A storm over Perfume River</figcaption></figure>

Near the river was a large white lotus shaped restaurant, intriguing but a little too kitschy for our taste. We set about exploring the Eastern streets of Hue, shopping for snacks, tweezers and other odds and ends. Down a small side alley we found a recommended restaurant, one of Lonely Planet's top picks, Anh Binh, and it looked nice.

But our table had ants on it, and when we moved they came with us. It seems every evening meal in Hue would be thwarted by ants of some kind or another. We persevered, our springs rolls were of the average out-of-a-packet variety and came with a peculiar snowman carving. The mains were average too, Sam described her beef dish as “normal”, my eel dish was tasty, but all too boney. The Lonely Planet description wasn't fitting at all. The demeanour of the waiters was interesting too, any orders were shouted, one at a time, to the next person, one by one until it reached the kitchen. The furniture was nice though.

For our final full day in Hue we took a taxi to the imperial city, this time going with food and leaving earlier so it wasn't as hot.

We returned to the imperial enclosure and the Royal Theatre for the dancing we had missed. There was meant to be a 10am showing, but when we arrived those running the show said they needed at least five more people. Not to be put off, Sam set about recruiting these people, and she got enough interest that the show went ahead as planned.

The performance was by the Theatre of Hue and Traditional Arts, and many of the dances originated here as part of the imperial court. The theatre itself had row after row of red and golden chairs leading to an ornate stage with a throne at the centre. Dragons swirl about the edges, and upstairs a balcony surrounded the room. It had all been rebuilt on former foundations, and had originally started in 1826.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Samantha, waiting for the show to begin](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-352.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-352.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Samantha, waiting for the show to begin</figcaption></figure>

The opening act saw four men, dressed in red and gold robes, playing traditional instruments. A simple introduction that made way to a dragon dance. Two large dragons, one yellow, one green, each moved by two dancing people, swayed and pranced about the stage, behaving as if they were real, a convincing illusion. Their giant heads swayed to the beat of a carnal drum, and they ceremoniously mated to magically produce a baby dragon. It was all very impressive.

<figure class="generated-figure generated-figure--retina generated-figure--620 generated-figure--landscape">[![Dragon and baby](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/1240/hue-353.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/hue-353.jpg)<figcaption class="generated-figure-caption">Dragon and baby</figcaption></figure>

The second dance was a fan dance (vũ phiến), and eight ladies in pink, with yellow fans in each hand and blue headdresses swirled and moved to create undulating repeating patterns. They'd line up and create cascading fan effects, rippling down the line in a manner that felt natural and harmonious, as if one.

A nine piece instrumental act followed, with even more weird and wonderful instruments I'd never seen or heard before. And then to the finale, a sixteen person lantern dance (lục cúng hoa đăng), all the lights dimmed, and in each hand they held a candle. Moving in the dark, the flames floated, creating magical shapes; the dancers lifted each other up, higher and higher, making ever more strange and interesting compositions of light, all to traditional live music.

Only half an hour long, it was very good, and worth the early morning and 70,000 dong. Leaving the theatre, we went East, to the ruins of the Thai to Mieu temple, which is now a beautiful little garden, nursing new trees and bonsai trees alike. A bamboo bridge had been built across a small lagoon, in the centre of which a new temple was being constructed. Purple water lilies flowered below.

We followed the road around the edge of the enclosure, past the University of Arts and to the West corner, and the restored Truong San residence. Although the buildings were beautiful, they were themselves empty, dark and echoey inside. Still water surrounded them, like a moat, and filled with purple flowers. A young girl and her mum played amongst the yellow walled, red doored buildings of the house, flowers in their hair, sitting on the steps and being cute for the camera. The walls were rich with colour, blue shapes marked into yellow walls, sculptures standing tall on ornate gateways. On the rooftops, gaudi-esque dragons clamber from the corners, and blue marbled sculptures are embedded in the walls. The old, original imperial city must have been very special.

We walked south to the Dien Tho residence, this was larger and just as beautiful, with wooden rooms, and a wooden 'pleasure pavilion' atop a small pond.

And from here we found ourselves where we left off on Thursday, the To Mieu Temple complex. This complex is beautifully restored, and seemingly escaped most of the bombing. In a courtyard, nine unique bronze urns line the front of a temple, and two dragons sit in red phone boxes to the left and right, staring at each other, as they do. On one side, the dark red To Mieu temple, on the other the three tiered Hien Lam Pavilion.

We had to take our shoes off before entering the temple which houses shrines and dedications to each of the former emperors. Each shrine is placed in a line, with a portrait on top. The ceilings and columns are a deep red, with golden engravings and ribbons. Red and gold everywhere.

Outside the pavilion a local art class were sketching their own interpretations of dragons, bronze urns and the buildings. Younger children sat on the dragon balustrades, pretending to ride them. Of course Sam had to have a go too.

And now we had seen all four corners of the enormous imperial city. We left via the central temple, then out through the north exit and a little cafe on the north most wall where we had Vietnamese coffee. Outside it started to rain.

Hungry, we set about exploring the eastern part of the citadel, the city beyond the imperial enclosure. t was much like the rest of Hue, streets of shops, sometimes lined with trees, most with traffic problems or crazy mopeds mounting kerbs.

We found a two tiered local restaurant for lunch, Ngo Co Nhan, with very cheap spring rolls and rice. We sat upstairs, on a bamboo balcony beneath a straw roof. Next to us a group of four men were jovial, at the foot of their table a towering crate of Tiger beer already finished, at least 16 bottles between them. And more on the way. The waitress sat in the corner watching a mounted TV, Hot Shots was on, Ramona was talking to Topper Harley. She didn't laugh at any of the jokes. On our way out, downstairs, another couple had been drinking a lot too, about six bottles each this time.

Nearby we heard a school reciting a daily ritual, walking past, we saw Ho Chi Minh's portrait sitting above the blackboard. Outside were toy shops. We continued south, following the main roads, exiting the Citadel, and turning left to find Dong Ba market. We used a local to shield us crossing the busy road.

The market was a network of thin partially covered alleyways, stalls clambering for business, business men holding wads of cash, women shouting for you to buy their food, or hat, or chopsticks, or fruit. Hue is known for it's Vietnamese hats, you can get nice ones that have patterns when held up to the light. We found one and bargained for it, we got the price down to one we wanted to pay, though I'm sure it could have been cheaper. That perpetual Vietnamese feeling that somehow you're being ripped off, even if you've bought a hat for £1\. The hat was big, bulky and wonderful. It lasted our entire holiday and sits with pride and place on our wall in our flat. I didn't think it would last beyond Hue.

We took a taxi back to the hotel, Sam relaxed by the pool while I uploaded photos to Dropbox, a continuous backup of our images as we go - but time consuming and troublesome using an iPad to do it.

Our Lonely Planet food recommendations had let us down on a couple of occasions, and Trip Advisor reviews weren't being helpful either. In the end we settled on another meal at the hotel. Expensive, but the first night's food was fabulous gourmet, and we wanted more of the same. Sadly the food wasn't as great as before. Nestled in a quiet corner of the restaurant, I had the pan fried Mahi Mahi with chocolate and vietnamese coffee. And Sam had Grilled Pork Mousse on lemongrass skewer - a rather unceremonious reformed pork ball on a stick. But our starters, duck foie gras and traditional spring rolls, were lovely, as too was the Kir Royale we treated ourselves to.

We retired to the bar for a couple of games of pool and called it a night, our last night in Hue, ready for another adventure elsewhere.

Most of the morning in Hue was spent packing. Sam ran about taking photos of the hotel too, and all the emperor's portraits scattered about the place. We had one last breakfast at La Residence, the kind Irish chef made Sam a couple of pancakes and a dippy runny egg. Enough to keep her going all day. As usual I couldn't eat much, it being travel day and breakfast time.

It was time to go and our bags were bulging, bursting at the seams and, of course, heavy. We still had two weeks to go! From the hotel we took a taxi to the station, what would have been a five minute walk, but we'd tried that before. This train was on time, and we clambered on board. Two seats were dedicated to our bags, good job the train wasn't busy. Little did we know today was Vietnam's celebration of independence and Ho Chi Minh's birthday.

It was a four hour trip. And we were on our way to Phong Nha, via Dong Hoi.
