I’m currently sitting on a train, travelling from Prague through to Berlin, we’re getting off at Dresden for a day trip. It takes about two hours. The rolling green scenery and river Vltava are going past, basking in glorious sunshine. A group of sleepy Americans surround us.

Waking at 3:45am and flying from London Gatwick at 6:45am, we touched down in Prague (after sleeping through the flight), in the sun. Here we were greeted by Rebecca, our host, adorning a single flower for Samantha, she bought us coffee before guiding us through the public transport system; bus, Metro and tram.

After a phase of rejuvenation through English Tetley tea and spurious instructions on how to use the flat, four of us set out for a tour of the south-western fortifications, with a secret route in through the back. Inside we were amidst a mock Byzantine church and a graveyard of noteworthy Czechs, topped off by a view across the city towards the castle in the north. At the lil’ cafe in the corner we munched our crab-stick cocktails and tuna salad, which kept us going a little further. First Czech beer: Gambrinus (king of beer), nothing overwhelming.

Rebecca and co. headed home whilst Sam and I explored a little more, walking up the river, into town, stopping at the first island; exhausted we fell asleep on the walls, circled by pedalos and wispy willow tree fluff.

Not quite reaching the National Theatre, our feet not able to take us much further, we turned back for home - but not before feasting on stone-baked pizza in a hidden student tavern.

Over hills and following tram routes, we got a feel for the area - beautiful architecture and frescoes marked with graffiti and dirt, what felt like a run-down neighbourhood populated by Mercedes and Audis alike. Spires sat at every intersection and it was clear Prague had been through a lot. Rebecca and Lynn flew home that evening, leaving us to our own devices.

Come Thursday, after a twelve-hour sleep and some shopping from the local Bila supermarket, we explored the next big bit of the city. Moving down from the museum and St Wenceslas square, into Stare Mesto, through the winding streets to Charles Bridge. It felt like Venice--cramped and tourist driven. We didn’t cross the bridge, instead we carried along the river, setting down by the Jan Palach square to note events of interest in the Prague Post. We doubled back through Josefov, past the Golem synagogue (Staronova Synagoga) and dodging the old chitty-chitty cars that give tours, making our way home in a roundabout way. Back at the flat, Sam’s culinary skills cooked us up a paprika stew and potato salad, and again we collapsed.

On Friday it rained and with rain came indoor events! At the National Museum we swotted up on the Czech’s first republic and Mr. Masaryk (a temporary “Republica” exhibition). We timed our trip home to imperfection, getting caught up in thunderstorms and great balls of hail--creating rivers where there should be roads.

That night we dressed up for the Prague State Opera’s rendition of Madame Butterfly, it was to be our first opera. Tickets cost 400Kc, for seats near the top, but with a good view of stage and accompanying English subtitles. We drank bubbly and ate salami and cheese 'open' sandwiches on the Opera House’s balcony, looking out at Prague.

We set aside Saturday and Sunday to explore the castle (prazsky hrad) and the area over the river, Prague 1\. We took the 22 tram up to the top of the hill and walked down into the castle grounds from behind. Whilst I purchased our access all areas tickets, Sam tried a free “spicy chilli” food sampling which left her crying and red faced - if there had been a bucket filled with water, I think she’d have used it.

The queues to the cathedral, which ran from the entrance right down the side, diverted us to the St. George national gallery. We both fell in love with the tiny postcard sized “A Red Parasol in the Summertime” by Josef Manes (1855). Moving on, the Powder Tower with its three floors of army histories and dressed up mannequins was lackluster. In the beautiful warm sunshine we sat on a wall (before moving to a hidden courtyard) and ate the pre-prepared potato salad, grapes and scrumptious cherry tomato picnic. (Aside: these were the tastiest cherry tomatoes I’ve ever come across with a fresh and juicy explosion when eaten whole).

![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/prague-04-painting-parasol-summertime.jpg)

Sated, we learned all about the castle’s history--both old and recent, St Vitus, Wenceslas, phases of construction et al, zipping through the end of the exhibition because we were cold. We entered the cathedral itself just as the sunlight poured through the central stained glass windows, colouring the walls pink and purple. The crypt and southern tower were closed, leaving only the circular tour of the ground floor with its various chapels.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/prague-05-stained-glass.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/prague-05-stained-glass.JPG)

We skipped Golden Lane, Kafka’s house and the old palace and had a cursory look at St George’s Basilica; all cultured out we took panoramic photos and stumbled down the steep hill into town, ready for an evening meal, albeit an early one.

The Lonely Planet guide pointed us towards, “The Maltese Knights”, not much to look at from above, but downstairs the restaurant came into its own, a converted cavern, candlelit and mysteriously romantic. In shorts, and clearly tourist attire, I ate a delicious wild-boar steak in rose-hips sauce, Sam chose the lamb, sauerkraut and apple. We washed it down with an ’07 Muller-Thurgau white wine.

It’s now Friday afternoon, my commentary was cut short because we had to get off the train to Dresden. I’m now sitting in the delightful Lucerna music bar off Wenceslas square, listening to the live piano music  and drinking Bailey’s coffee and Darjeeling “Eilles” tea.

On Sunday, after the Maltese Knights, we took the 11/22 trams to the castle for our second round of sightseeing, though at Malostranska we opted for a walk through the town, trekking up Nerudova and Uvoz for some spectacular panoramics. And despite the heat, we eventually reached Strahovska zahrada at the top.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/prague-07-panoramic.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/prague-07-panoramic.JPG)

Starving and exhausted, and after discarding copious tourist eateries, we settled on St Norbert’s brewery, within the grounds of the monastery. The “black beer” was gorgeous, so too was my mustard and honey barbecued pork--Sam wasn’t so keen on her goulash and dumplings.  Norbert’s special white beer was also tasty. After purchasing a glass we walked towards the mock Eiffel tower, up more steep hills and through the woods. For 150Kc we climbed to the top, with Sam just about managing her vertigo. Stunning 360 degree views of Prague awaited, including the stadium and castle.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/prague-08-panoramic.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/prague-08-panoramic.JPG)

The climb down wasn’t so quick - the spiral staircase and downward views left Sam’s head spinning. With a thirst quenching coke we perused some enclosed gardens and descended the hill along a different path, around the hillside tram route and past the communist memorial, we crossed the river at Vitezna and passed the Narodni divaldo.

After a small tram mishap we were home, changed for the evening, and back out again, back to Mala Strana. We ate in a superbly decorated tavern, tables were fixed upside down on the ceiling and walls garnished with quirky paintings. Sam adored her roasted lamb parcel, my mixed grill was mediocre, although the opportunity to taste the excellent black ‘Kozel’ beer was a plus. They also charged for tap water and a starter offered as “as present”. C’est la vie.

At the Lucerna we’re onto Irish coffee with Jameson and French coffee with Cognac.

Dresden, reached via train, on Tuesday was a breath of fresh air. A relatively small city in Saxony, Germany, it has an intertwined mix of old and new, clean and chirpy we instantly loved it. On our walk towards the river we stopped for Euros and patisseries--one of many little detours to buy the German’s tasty baked goods.

The heat was sweltering, 35C or so, we passed the commercial sector, crossed the tramlines making sure to avoid the yellow beasts, into the old town with views of the ornate Hofkirche and Zwinger palace, before reaching the Elbe riverside and a cafe. Our first opportunity for some German beer, Wernesgruner, although Sam almost ordered bourbon.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/dresden-01-arrival.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/dresden-01-arrival.JPG)

With a whistle-stop tour of the old town we passed the lengthy Furstenzug mural and stopped at restaurant Kleppereck for lunch. In the course of an hour or so the clear blue skies had grown perilous with storms and heavy rain--with my Duckstein beer in one hand and potato soup in the other we nipped indoors for the rest of our meal. Sam enjoyed the pickled herring with fried potatoes and sour cream. I had the Bruckenmeistersteak with smoked bacon, jacket potato and yoghurty cream. We shared a yummy ‘apfel’ strudel for dessert.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/dresden-02-duckstein.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/dresden-02-duckstein.JPG)

At a break in the rain we ran for it, finding the Ibis hotel and booking a night there, shortly followed by a two hour nap and shower. Dressed and ready for the night we set out at 7--the Coselpalais with its ornate interior and perfect locale took our fancy, right opposite the Frauenkirche. Once again we sat outside briefly before the rain hurried us inside, a wise decision - this time the rain was unrelenting, getting harder and heavier as the night went on.

The food here was divine, the three hours spent here act as testament to this. Asparagus and sesame seed soup opened the proceedings. For mains I ate the succulent roasted musk duck breast with sesame dumplings and gorgeous peaches and leeks. Sam had the roasted saddle of lamb, with ewe’s milk cheese and olive herbal crust and potato torte. WOW! With rain battering down dessert was the only option. Samantha chose a chocolate sponge - milk, white and a thin layer of dark chocolate, layered with fruits of the forrest. I tried the home-made Tiramisu, the best I’ve had yet, it came with wild-berries and pistachios grated over cream - truly scrumptious. Not yet ready to leave, and with theatre-goers coming in drenched, we shared eine Bailey’s coffee and eine coffee with Kahlua, cream and chocolate syrup.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/dresden-03-coselpalais.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/dresden-03-coselpalais.JPG)

When the time came to leave the storm was directly above us. A bolt of lightning shot across the night sky, lighting up the Frauenkirche in a perfect photo opportunity missed as I stood in the doorway amongst sapling waterfalls. In our summer clothes, without our pre-packed warmth back in Prague, what are the chances then that this restaurant sold umbrellas? We bought one and a tin of coffee from their souvenir shop and, in the rain (navigating the streams and lakes of Dresden’s streets), returned to the hotel--thoroughly happy.

Back at the Lucerna, we’ve got our bill for the coffees and its time to go again, further exploration of Prague required!

<!--nextpage-->

I’m now on the Easyjet flight home, the attendants are selling perfumes and other crap.

Dresden day two was overcast, and the sun didn’t return for the rest of the holiday. Early in the morning we checked out of the Ibis, grabbed some croissant and raspberry savouries and headed to the river to catch a steam boat. For 30 Euros we travelled upstream to Pillnitz, 90 minutes each way, on a fully functional 100 year old steam boat, complete with cafe. The wind billowed whilst Sam roughly translated the German commentary, passing old castles and stately homes.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/DSC05385.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/DSC05385.JPG)

At Pillnitz we ate large pretzels and more tasty tasty patisserie desserts before exploring the mountain palace, its gardens and orangery. After a brief chat with a lovely German lady, pleased to see foreign tourists in the gardens, we trotted back to the boat, with quiche and ham roll in hand.

Back on land in Dresden, after sleeping the trip back, we crossed the river to explore the new town. The graffiti here, unlike Prague, was smart and interesting, the shops original and the area swimming in student culture and modern art. Our best find was the kunsthofpassage, a small alley of shops selling hand made goods and many weird but cool items. The walls of the buildings were decorated with wondrous designs of drain pipes and wildlife - an amazing commercial community of artists.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/DSC05387.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/DSC05387.JPG)

We ate at Kurfurstenshanke, next to the Coselpalais, in the old town. A place that, in every respect, wanted to be the Coselpalais. I had the flame grilled lamb skewer with zucchini and pepper, whilst Sam had the Ostrich medallions and veg, with not enough sauce. It also came with something delightfully described as “potato squidge”. The Krusovice dark beer was good, Sam’s melon lemonade not so (as I’m typing this, my exotic juice and Sprite concoction was very tasty).

With a few Euros left to spend, we kept the Krusovice glass with its outline of Prague castle, bought Sam a new bag and grabbed some more tasty treats (doughnuts!) for the journey home. Back on the train we cut through the beautiful Konigstein valley and Bad Schandau, then later, under a coal power station rollercoaster. The difference between Germany and the Czech republic was immediately apparent. Far from home, we still had to endure the less than joyful trend of people blasting hip hop music loud and clear for everyone to hear out of their phone or laptop speakers; in this case from the seats behind ours. The Ballack lookalike did not look impressed.

Thursday, back in Prague, and rested after a very late lie in, there was doom and gloom outside, 12 centigrade and heavy rain. Sam cooked an awesome Spanish omelette for us before we departed for the Czech Beer festival. Passing ticket inspectors at the Metro, we reached the beer tents wearing entirely the wrong clothing. Freezing, we fund minimum drink sizes were 0.5L and neither of us really fancied it--the full sized cow on a spit was also a little off putting.

Back at home we bought tasty Italian wine, cooked Tuna Neapolitan and went to sleep to the sounds of Nina Simone and Django Reindhart.

Friday we tried something a little different, up early with packed lunch in tow, we were at Nadrazi Holesovice by 9am, to catch a bus to Melnik. Confused by the timetables we latched onto the first English speaking folk we found, two travelers from Australia and NZ. We spent the rest of the trip with them.

For 4kc each we reached Melnik in about 45 minutes, and walked the small hill into town. At Melnik Zamek, a renaissance chateau, we took the self guided tour and wine tasting. Walking through ornate stately rooms we learnt about Wenceslas lunettes and 17th century maps, from our sheets of paper. Phase two took us down into a hidden cellar (we spent a good 15 minutes trying to find the entrance) where ten bottles, a water fountain, some barrels and brown herbed bread (that Sam hates) lay waiting; a do it yourself wine tasting session. The Muller Thurgau was rancid and acidic, we all agreed, some of us liked their Pinot Noir. There was much discussion over the sweeter dessert wine which we couldn’t drink much of.

With the rain beating down hard, the only food option was the castle’s restaurant. My opportunity to sample the local beef stroganoff and dumplings, although I can’t say I was too impressed. The views from here were spectacular, as we watched the bands of rain pass by, a hill in the distance (Rip, where legend says Cech and Lech stopped before forming the Czech and Pole nations), disappearing and re-appearing periodically. We chattered over dinner about traveling through Eastern Europe, life down under, places to visit, sights to see; Sam scribbled notes frantically--I remember a trip to Vilnius was on the new to do list.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/DSC05417.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/DSC05417.JPG)

Stopping for some much cheaper Bohemian glass and oddly shaped Melnik wine purchases (we didn’t buy the huge wine glass in the shop window, despite Sam’s pleads), we retraced our steps to the bus shelter. The rain gave us a 10 minute gap to make a dash for it.

We said farewells to our temporary travelling friends, and with Dresden umbrella in hand, we took Metro line B to Muzeum, and in the pouring rain explored the side streets of Wenceslas square. Amongst our findings were board game shops, quirky wine and souvenir shops and the excellent Lucerna, where we spent much of the afternoon drinking alcoholic coffees and listening to live piano music.

After toying with the idea of returning home, we changed our minds and stayed in town. In the rain we followed Sam’s carefully devised plans for the evening. Finding U modre kachnicky in Mala Strana for dinner--a purposefully expensive treat with a menu specializing in duck and game dishes. Rather than starters, we treated ourselves to their Kir Royale. As my main dish I had honey and ginger roasted duck on a bed of raisin rice, contained beautifully in a bed of lettuce. I don’t like ginger, but this was gorgeous. Sam’s duck course, with peaches, was equally yummy. When we arrived a waiter was lovingly preparing fruit crepes for some Americans, mixing and cooking the sauce on a gas stove in front of them, with “oohs” and “aahs” as poured alcohol put on a flame show. We had to have one too, despite being full we found a space for this scrumptious delight.

Sam’s plan--part 2, saw us head out into the night in search of some jazz. It seems the areas recommended in our outdated Lonely Planet guide either had no music on or were no more. The proper, “pay for jazz”, venue had a spooky vocal act on that freaked Sam out. Instead we chose an early night and an early Saturday morning.

Early meaning we left the flat at 7:15am, getting to old town square by 8am! The streets were empty, and the sights at last a pleasure to witness. No tourists, no tour groups, pick pocketers, artists, moneymakers or taxis. Charles Bridge was the same, clear and enjoyable. Perfect for some photos too (bar the weather maybe). The bride we saw dashing about the place must have thought the same.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/DSC05436.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/DSC05436.JPG)

For breakfast the Savoy was shut, the Kaverna Slavia over the bridge was a very good choice. Two of the best fresh croissants outside of France, a supreme zucchini and aubergine omelette (Sam’s bacon omelette was also tasty), orange juice and an exciting cinnamon espresso--all from a riverside table with a castle view. Quite quietly brilliant.

For the rest of the morning we explored side streets in Stare Mesto, perusing the astronomically priced Bohemian crystal store off the old square, with its chandeliers. We purchased some choice works of art that represented our time here, six or so.

When hours had passed and people had woken from their slumber, we crossed Charles Bridge towards  Mala Strana, up Trziste, through some lanes and out onto Nerudova, stopping at U Zeleneho Yaje for fancy teas. Smoked moldovian tea with milk, sugar and vanilla--very WOW. Sam’s strong Irish tea with cocoa beans, served in a ceramic tea pot was not so interesting, but equally tasty, as was the marble cake! It’d been empty on arrival, but as we left the girl taking orders and making teas was frantically busy serving customers.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/DSC05453.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/DSC05453.JPG)

Going back down the hill, we stumbled into the Valdstejnska zahrada gardens, with their albino peacock and peculiar grotto wall. In search of lunch our luck turned a little, the Lebanese mezes place no longer existed, all the cute cafes didn’t serve food and we didn’t fancy roasted piglet. We ended up at a posh but entirely pretentious place,  we stayed for starters, a good decision. Nauseating tiles in the bathrooms and a toilet inducing indoor water feature didn’t help matters. Sam’s potato and poached egg soup tasted odd, incredibly sweet and by the end quite sickly. My soup of the day, lentils, was just a bit normal and tasteless, filling a gap nonetheless. We later figured they had seasoned Sam’s soup with sugar instead of salt. With bill paid, we left the place that couldn’t do soup.

Heading under Charles Bridge, along Na Kampe, we found some charming pottery places, where we dreamt of a house to put things in. Coming back up via St Nicholas’s church, we paid a visit to the recommended St Nicholas’s cafe for the next course. Supposedly an original underground dwelling, it was more of a smoky pizzeria that couldn’t do Coke and garlic bread properly.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/DSC05470.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/DSC05470.JPG)

Disgruntled, with very tired legs, about 8 hours of walking by now, we crossed at Manesuv most, heading for home. But we wanted a night out! So, despite our weariness, we darted straight for “Red Hot &amp; Blues” near Namesti Republiky, via a gift shop for some cups. With two tequila margheritas from the happy hour offer Sam was quickly off her head. My dark Staropramen didn’t have the same effect. Craving some normal food, chicken fajitas and chips sufficed.

Joined by a rowdy but well behaved Irish group, we jived to the sounds of a New Orleans blues performance. An enormous kazoo playing black guy led the vocals, with a distinctly opposite small and white guy on piano and harmonica, usually at the same time, very impressive!

After thanking them and moving on, it was time (10pm) for some serious Jazz at U stare pani, an underground low-lit red light club with 250kc music cover charge. Tonight the Walter Fischbacher trio were playing. This was real jazz; piano drums and bass. The mesmerizing tunes dipped from classical to funky to a rompous messy moment that beautifully fell into a new rhythm. Rolling piano solos got the crowd howling with applause and when the tempo upped itself, the collective “wow” was tangible.

We were served by a chirpy and kind waitress that met our every need, the drinks kept coming. Bailey’s coffee, Mexican coffee (rum, kahlua, coffee and cream), white russians, margheritas and even Bailey’s cheesecake. We spent a fortune and loved every second.
Even for the USP, this act was something special. We didn’t hesitate in buying the CD. Nothing short of awesome.

Catching the penultimate trams home, our mammoth 18 hour day in Prague drew to a close--a magical day wherein we found the hidden joys of the Czech capital; embracing the culture, seeing the sights and jamming to the music, a perfect ending.

Sunday was a later starter, mostly filled with chores; cleaning and preparing the flat for our departure. Late breakfast left us eating the last of the salad, cheese, scrumptious vine tomatoes, bread and frankfurters, leaving some for the flight home.

We nipped out at 3pm for one last meal in Prague, going to the Kaverna Slavia, via the Tancici dum. Although much more noisy and busy, we still enjoyed the glorious food and views of the castle. Samantha tried the breadcrumbed asparagus and spinach salad followed by a smoked salmon crepe. As per usual, soup started my meal--this time being beef broth with meatballs. Then after, I was treated to a surprise delight. Turkey with czech cheese, cranberries and potato torte was simply divine!

And that was that; the tram-metro-bus route to the airport was smooth as you like and we spent remaining CZK on Krusovice beer and glasses plus some demi-sec Bohemian champagne.

The flight home is now over and it’s back to working life again.
