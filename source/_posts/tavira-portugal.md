We had one more opportunity for a holiday while Sam was on maternity leave, and before baby Conway started nursery. A slim window in October just as things were hotting up at work for me.

We wanted somewhere warm and relaxing; a relative lives in Munich – someone to help with childcare would be perfect – but Octoberfest inflated prices and all hotels were beyond expensive. Then a friend recommended Tavira in The Algarve. Warm, by the sea, a nice old town, plenty of good food, national parks. It sounded perfect for a weeklong break.

On Friday we booked EasyJet flights from Gatwick, on Saturday we found our hotel and on Tuesday we flew out. EasyJet as usual were very good to our family, we ate pre-made boiled eggs on the plane and arrived half an hour early in Faro, where we picked up our car rental – a black Fiat 500L. Conway had a Chico baby seat set up in the back.

I have little experience driving on the right. Just one nerve wracking day climbing the hills in Madeira in an old rental with no 3rd gear. After two laps of the car park, and a couple of times smacking the door with my knuckles as I tried to change gear on the wrong side, we were on our way to the hotel. Just a half hour drive down one of Portugal’s tolled and empty freeways.

Hotel Rural Quinta do Marco

We chose a place out of town, somewhere that required a rental – its a 10 minute drive from Tavira. It ranked highly on Trip Advisor and was affordable. It had looked like they had no availability, but we called ahead, they reshuffled some rooms and we had a place for 8 nights. We could never remember the hotel’s full name.

Nested on a hill, our room looked out over the brown hills of The Algarve, down to the distant sea. At sunrise the sun lifted its head above the horizon and dazzled the restaurant, where breakfast is served.

Breakfast was good for the price; breads, meats, fruit, average coffee and delicious freshly made Portuguese egg tarts (Pastéis de Nata). We mostly ate the tarts. Conway liked the giant raisins, much to his mum’s chagrin.

Our room was a good size, two single beds pushed together making a large and comfortable bed. There was a zingy pink travel cot for Conway. Two doors opened onto a little terracotta balcony and we had a bathroom with a bath – perfect for bathing a 10 month old. Conway explored the tiled floors with zeal, finding the few things he shouldn’t touch, like plug sockets and pens. There was a bidet, and it didn’t take long for Conway to work out how to turn on the tap and push down the plug.

The hotel had a pool and a jacuzzi, and some well hidden benches to admire the view from. The beach bar wasn’t staffed and the hotel was quiet until the weekend, when it filled up for two nights.

Around the grounds we enjoyed the fresh smell of flowering jasmine. Rosemary and fig trees grew about the place and a little water system housed a place for terrapins. At the back there was a sad little farm area with pecked hens, peacocks, sheep and a donkey, under plenty of shade. We showed Conway the farm animals, which he enjoyed until a honking goose made him cry.

Relaxing on arrival

After travelling we sought only to chill in the hotel. Tavira could wait until tomorrow. On the veranda we sat with toasted tuna baguettes and cold beer and took in the warmth of our surroundings.

We sat by the pool, songbirds flitted about the trees nearby. A friend has a theory that travel causes babies to make developmental leaps. Conway had been crawling for a while, but on the sun-loungers by the pool he found a new impetus to climb – up and onto, over and down, then onto the next, he leapfrogged each one until he reached a bank of flowers that distracted him. Perhaps it was the weird grass that made him do it, he didn’t like how it felt beneath him, a little crisper than usual, he crawled on his knees, feet held in the air to minimise contact.

We tried the hotel’s restaurant for dinner, which served meals above our expectation. I had cod with almonds, figs and spinach, Samantha had a wild boar stew and Conway played peekaboo with the placemats.

---

For our first full day in Tavira the skies were clear and the sun hot, we sought only to acclimatise and explore the town.

After our first breakfast, a supply run to Pingo Doce supermarket and some heated arguments about which roundabout was which – as we did laps of the ring road, we parked across the river (in what would become our regular parking spot – the car park always had spaces, it was easy to get to and free) and set out on foot.

In the midday heat (it took us a while to get out of the hotel), the best thing to do first is climb the biggest, steepest hill, which we climbed towards the camera obscura and castle ruins. Thankfully there’s a cafe up there too, A Ver Tavira, where we settled for milkshakes and chicken wraps.

Groups of German tourists played peekaboo with Conway as we siphoned off tasty morsels of our lunch for him to try, though apple and orange were all he really wanted.

The castle is a ruin, a large corner being most of what’s survived, it surrounds an exotic garden where jasmine and rhododendron flower. In the shade two buskers filled the air with guitar strums and folk songs,  Conway danced to their music and they sung him one of their tunes, “big man, with a big house, with a big car, with big love, big man”, it went.

Our tour of Tavira continued; down the hill into the centre, along the river to where boats dock and their companies sell trips out to beaches and islands. It was touristy, but it was peaceful and quaint, a place where there’s much for tourists, but it isn’t ever hawked or thrust at you. The summer throngs haven’t yet eroded this place’s quiet charm.

A modern bar, Terraze, sits at the top of town, and while Conway napped we sat there by the river and snacked on fries. We reapplied sun lotion just in time for the clouds to turn the sky a light grey.

Casa do Polvo


With so many places to eat, we didn’t want to start with a dud. Especially as we were celebrating an anniversary. An initial look at Trip Advisor and Foursquare showed mixed reviews; many places had excellent ratings, but each were potted with “this is just ok”. In hindsight everywhere we tried was excellent, but today we consulted the only reliable guide: that Michelin one. They recommended a place just out of town in Santa Luzia – Casa do Polvo, or “House of Octopus”.

Santa Luzia is the octopus capital of Europe, and most restaurants along the seafront are polvo something.  We parked opposite, and we walked along the promenade while we waited for it to open.

Old men chatted on wooden benches, they smiled and cooed at Conway in the baby carrier. Boats bobbed up and down in the shallow water. In the distance sun rays broke through the clouds onto Rio Formosa national park. The air smelt of sea, and gulls circled above. Summer homes looked empty, and restaurants prepared for the evening.

Back at the restaurant and a queue was forming, there were seats outside – clearly queues are the norm here. First in the queue, a woman who’d tried on two previous occasions to eat here but it had always been full. When they opened we waltzed in first time and picked a table in the middle of it all, a few minutes later they were full. Perhaps there is some convenience in eating with a baby as soon as a restaurant opens.

Now, Casa do Polvo served us quite exquisite food, and of course we ordered octopus:

• Oven baked Octopus with garlic, apricot, almonds and rosemary
• Octopus stew with potatoes and beans

And the cephalopods were succulent, the tentacles and suckers were soft and flavourful, none of that toughness you come to expect from octopus. We offered Conway some of the best bits, but he was in no mood to eat.

Although our meal was divine, our experience was one of the more stressful dinners we’ve had. Conway, having been in a pushchair all day wasn’t going to sit quietly and eat with us, he wanted to explore and climb and shout. It wasn’t misbehaviour, more a desire for adventure. The high chair provided was a little metal thing that hangs from the table’s edge, it had no straps and once Conway had worked out he could get his legs free he wouldn’t stay in it. As the restaurant filled and grew loud, and as waitresses squeezed between the crammed in tables and chairs with large plates of tentacle done every which way, we took shifts holding baby while the other ate – an octopus statue kept his attention for a short while. At one point Sam was breastfeeding while stooped over her plate trying to eat a tentacle one handed, like spaghetti. Thankfully my stew came with a lid which kept it warm amidst this mayhem.

We shared dishes, I gobbled up mine, then took Conway outside to some exciting benches as Sam finished hers in peace. The tide was out now, and on the beach fiddler crabs scuttled around, I tried to show Conway but his attention was drawn to the lights on the fishing boats, which were all headed out for the night.

He fell asleep on the drive home, and we transferred him to the cot without him waking. Times with baby have changed, and restaurant-going will be harder. Though it is easier if you’re willing to forego all the social norms; standing during a meal, making a mess, talking to other tables, taking your time.

Thursday was a washout. We seem to have this affect on sunny places; in Malaga it rained when we visited – weeks of clear skies and sunshine turned to heavy rain when we arrived. It seems the same is happening in Tavira. The skies were grey and all day a fine drizzle fell.

Everything in the Algarve is set up for outdoors. Restaurants have outdoor seating, things to see and do are all outside. So for half the day we relaxed in the hotel, we gave Conway free roam of the restaurant area, and in our room he entertained himself with his pink and purple ball – just small enough to roll under the bed, whenever it was out of reach he’d spread eagle on the tiles and try to spot it, it was the cutest thing.

We filled our hotel room with music from my phone. Conway loves to dance, I put on Michael Jackson and let him bob and shake his bum with glee, there was even a little bit of foot movement.

We couldn’t keep baby cooped up all day, we asked staff about what indoor things there were to do. Any soft play areas? They suggested the shopping centre, we drove there in the rain. The most exciting bit was navigating the tight concrete ramps for the multi-storey car park. We found one suitable soft play – a little slide – it’d do. We did some supermarket shopping, but all the fancy looking cheese and meat we bought was pretty much tasteless.

Night time in Tavira


By dinner time the weather was clearing. The river in Tavira was still at sunset, and the distant towering rain clouds shone red. We stopped for photos.

For dinner Samantha stumbled on a fine pizzeria, Luzzo. It was new, and it used electronic tablets for their menus. The pizzas were delicious, and we introduced Conway to his first cheesy-tomato bread – he couldn’t get enough.

---

This morning the clear skies and warm sunshine returned, much to our relief. After breakfast we tried one of the short walks around the hotel.

With Conway in the baby carrier on my front, and Sam carrying supplies on her back, we embarked on a little 2.4km trek in the morning sun.

The route took us out along the back road, around some winding corners, walking along the edge of a tarmac road, then off onto a dirt track. Every now and then a stray dog, or dogs, would shout at us, all but one seemed harmless, that one dog that scared us had an owner who quietened it, we had to walk straight past the howling mutt, and I was aware of Conway’s toes poking out the carrier. But it was just inquisitive, and loud.

The route continued, and we found ourselves besides fields of lime, orange, lemon and pomegranate trees.  Every which way there were barren brown hills, earth and dirt rolling away down to the coast, the odd farmhouse and terracotta roof dotted amongst them. Conway quietly watched the world go by as we moved along, we just about broke a sweat, and then the route was finished and we were back.

We made the most of the sunshine then; swimming in the pool, playing in the jacuzzi, showing Conway all the bubbles, and we all napped together too.

Drive along the coast

With a sudden urge to get out and do things again, after two days of doing very little, we took the car out for the afternoon and drove East, towards the Spanish border.

We followed the A22 freeway and came off besides Altura – a lifeless tourist village with hotels and a nice beach. Conway was asleep in the car so we took turns to walk down to Praia de Altura and see the sea. We really aren’t beach people, and we’re happy to be staying somewhere characterised by culture rather than sand.

Our drive carried on, eastwards through Monte Gordo and Vila Real de Santo Antonio. Our research told us there was a large national park here, the “Castro Marim and Vila Real de Santo António Marsh Natural Reserve”. We expected some obvious activities, some nature walks, some easy bird watching places. “We’re in the reserve now”, Sam tells me, still roads and towns all around us.

Driving north to Castro Marim, we entered the heart of the reserve – ancient salt pans, marshes in all directions, and buildings on the rocky fringes, but no way to get out and enjoy these things. Weirdly we expected trees too, maybe it was the green on the Google map, there were no trees, and there was no green.

At Castro Marim a modern yet empty visitor centre played a video for us. On the door a sign said “fechado”, but they were open – two guys sat watching television. They fired up the projectors and the 20 minute video showed us the town, the marshes and the heritage. But we didn’t find a bird hide or a nature trail. Clearly a government grant had been spent on all the wrong things.

Google and Lonely Planet said the reserve was closed on weekends, we stressed that we might miss out. It’s not closed, only this very avoidable visitor centre is shut. And there’s little to miss. As it turns out, there are birding opportunities, but you need a 4x4 to go off road on the tracks around the salt plans. Our little fiat would get stuck on in the mud after recent rain.

Dinner at D’gusta

Back in Tavira we waited for the restaurants to open at 7pm. On a bench near the car park Conway walked up and down, holding on tight, bouncing, he smiled at every passerby, he’s such an adorable little baby, and so sociable.

D’gusta was booked up, but tables outside were free. We reserved one with a high chair. We thought a screeching baby might have less effect on the restaurant ambiance out here, what we didn’t consider were all the cars going by – and their lights – which distracted Conway all night. With all the people, noise and lights he wasn’t happy sitting and eating.

The evening sky turned pink with twilight, and the crescent moon hung above us. The tapas was perfect; each dish tasted amazing, they came as they were ready, they came quickly and we could pick and choose while shuffling Conway between us. And despite Conway’s excitement, we had dessert too.

The goats cheese, honey and almond toast was divine. The beef was scrumptious. The gratin and tuna tartare were delicious. Baby even enjoyed a bit of the garlic marinated Algarve carrots.

• Algarve carrots
• Chicken skewers in soy
• Tuna tartare
• Potato gratin
• Goats cheese and honey and almond on toast
• Beef and rocket and Parmesan
• Lime cheesecake
• Chocolate tart

Praia do Barril

Eager to do more, this morning we had breakfast and were up and out early to explore the coastline West of Tavira. After driving through a town of summer houses – neatly arranged, well pruned, and lived in only briefly, we parked up besides some marshes and a bridge towards the sea.

From the boardwalk you can take a little red and black diesel train to the sea – we wanted to see the scenery, the walk there and back interested us more than the sand and waves. On the sandy track alongside the rails we pushed Conway, his buggy fashioned with a muslin tied up as a makeshift sunscreen. From the path we saw waders and gulls foraging for lunch.

The marshes turn to dunes, and we found shade beneath the pine trees. The trains kept chugging by, ferrying people to the sea.

At the end of the path, where the rail tracks end and everyone disembarks, there’s a selection of restaurants and toilets; it was 11:30am so we opted for an early lunch at “Blue Beach Bar”, perhaps the worst of the options here (we realised only after, but maybe they’re all as good as each other, we had low expectations) – but the burger and tuna steak and the ginger mojito and passion fruit lemonade were all ok, and we’d avoided the midday rush of patrons.

Conway found more uncomfortable grass to crawl on. Of course we did go and see the beach – Conway had a few minutes investigating the sand, running his fingers through it, picking it up and watching the wind blow it away, trying to eat it, before he’d had enough. And Sam carried him down to the sea, leaving the buggy which would otherwise get stranded in the sand. But we didn’t stick around long.

In the early afternoon heat we walked back, trains still chugged on by, and when we reached the car we were ready for air conditioning. A large white stork waded through the marshes besides us.

No de gosto

After recuperating with a nap at the hotel we drove into Tavira for dinner. Most restaurants open at 7pm, but with a baby we needed earlier meals. In the triangle around Jardim da Alagoa we found No de gosto – we went there thinking it was a fish place, its blue and white decor suggests that, but they serve tapas. And they opened at 6:30pm, while all else is quiet. Perfect.

We took a table indoors, Conway had a highchair, and the proprietors brought baby books for him to examine. With very little else happening we had swift service, and fabulous food – even finding time for dessert:

• Bread and salted tuna butter and lupini beans
• Octopus canapés with zucchini and seaweed
• Anchovies with aubergine
• Prawns and charred chilli
• Duck and rice
• Spiced chocolate mousse
• Fig cheesecake

---

After a good night’s sleep, Conway didn’t wake us until 8am, we zipped out early for breakfast. Over the weekend our quiet hotel had filled up, and there’s not quite enough seats and tables for everyone. And we wouldn’t want to miss out on those egg tarts.

We were blessed with bright sunshine again, so this morning we returned to Tavira to explore the parts of town we hadn’t yet seen. We ditched the buggy and took Conway in a baby carrier around town – it was liberating – no longer did cobbles and raised curbs thwart us.

We climbed the steep hill to the castle. In hindsight a Sunday morning wasn’t the best time to go and see all the sights –the churches were busy, and the camera obscura was closed.

In a local bakery we rested with bread and cake – a TV showed a story about squirrel conservation, at a table well dressed mormons chatted following their morning service.

We looped up and around the town, crossed the river and found Luzzo again, a takeaway pizza for lunch eaten on a bench amidst some shrubbery and trees, and one hummingbird hawk moth (one of my favourite creatures in all the world), that I tried but failed to photograph.

For the rest of the day we stayed at our hotel, sleeping, drinking non-alcoholic beer by the pool, or reading. The restaurant was full with a christening, mum dressed in white like a bride – we’d guessed it was a wedding.

At the hotel restaurant I had roasted octopus, my third octopus of the trip, and Sam had a monkfish and rice stew. Conway was well behaved throughout, if only because an old British couple on a tour of Europe kept him entertained.

Birdwatching

The national parks and the prospect of some very good birdwatching was one of the reasons we chose to come to Tavira. I booked a last minute tour with www.birds.pt, and they said they could accommodate a baby. How do you go birding with a baby in tow? We weren’t really sure, but that shouldn’t stop us. Our pickup was at 8am, and we brought a packed breakfast.

Our guide was Ray Tipper, a sun-chapped Englishman living in Tavira, he gives regular professional tours and frequently leads birding trips abroad. He picked us up in his workhorse 4x4 Suzuki and we squeezed the baby car seat into the back, behind a fold down chair, the seatbelt just long enough to accommodate the Chico. Sam sat besides him and I sat up front. Conway cried for most of the drive to the Tavira salt pans, “he won’t be like this the whole time”, I said, and quietly hoped.

Now we thought we might be hiking, walking around pans, carrying baby, baby gear, cameras and binoculars. But the salt pans are all accessible by car, and a car makes the perfect portable hide – the birds ignore it. We stayed in the car, and when we drove it was very slowly, so we gave Conway free roam in the back of the jeep, and this was enough to entertain – he had space to play and he enjoyed watching the birds out of the window too.

Top of my ‘must see’ list was an Avocet. A beautiful black and white ground-nesting bird with a delicate long and curved bill. We also couldn’t come here without seeing the flamingoes.

We found our first gaggle of birds, rolled down the windows and rested cameras on beanbags for photos. My 400mm lens unavoidably poked out the side of the vehicle. Sanderlings, plovers and dunlin walked about the edges of the water. A white spoonbill flew over, followed shortly by flamingoes.

At the next pan we watched three juvenile flamingoes, white with touches of brown, rather than that distinctive pink they usually have.

The salt pans were being harvested, diggers were scraping and piling up the salt while trucks carted it away. The long hot summer had produced a bumper harvest of salt.

By the ruins of an old tuna fishing town there lived a little owl – that sounds like the opening of a children’s book – but we looked in all the rocky openings where its known to perch and it wasn’t to be seen this morning. By our window, in some shrubs a Sardinian warbler parked itself.

To get to some more pans we circled up and around a small farm. The brown dirt field was bobbled, like it was infested with moles, and that makes the perfect place for roosting stone curlews. We double backed a couple of times to try and spot them before Ray eyed them in the distance. We got out the scope and watched them prune. Stone curlews are bigger than I’d imagined, they’re large birds with bold eyes ringed with yellow. A fine sighting. Later we were fortunate too to see four more fly in front of us.

At the next pans I saw my much loved Avocets, joined by plovers, flamingoes, black tailed godwits, black stilts, red shanks, and a spoonbill. The overcast sky gave good light and the light wind left clear reflections in the water.

Beyond the pans are marshes, where we saw storks and herons, and a flock of shoveler ducks conveniently flew in front of a rainbow.

On our way out we stopped to see pans filled with different gull species, black-backed, slender billed, mediterranean, black-headed. A cormorant watched us from its perch.

From the East Tavira salt pans we headed West, through town, a quick toilet break, then out to [______]. The tide was out, and we didn’t see much more – except an azure magpie and a very exciting hoopoe – such a stunning bird.

Now the plan for the rest of the day was that Samantha and Conway would return to the hotel and Ray and I would drive onwards to Faro for some more birdwatching. But the heavens opened and the downpour killed any chance of seeing birds, “no self-respecting raptor would be out in this”, Ray said, so we called it off and paid for a half day.

Hard to eat on a Monday

The rain cleared up around 6pm, when we headed into town for our last night in Tavira. Many restaurants are closed on Mondays, we did our research, found a family friendly place – Food Factory – and headed straight there – a little out of town it took some walking from the car – but on arrival all was dark – the hours online and on the door said open, but it most definitely was not.

By the time we were back in town all the good places were full and it was late. We tried place after place, and ended up squeezing onto a dimly lit table at the front of Tavira Lounge, where the tube-lighting in the ice cream bar turned everything an odd greeny-yellow. We ordered a Portuguese salad and bruschetta, milkshake and cheesecake. And a plate of rice to give Conway something of substance. A peculiar meal all round.

On the drive home Conway fell asleep, for one last time we drove out of Tavira, across the bridge, out and up towards our hotel, driving on the right, in the dark, following the winding road back to our room.

---

Our flight out was mid-afternoon, we didn’t need to checkout until midday. We leisurely packed, had breakfast, and drank cola by the pool, the sunshine a little milder now.

The drive to Faro airport was uneventful, we tried to hand the car back to the wrong rental company, but otherwise all went well. At the airport we scoffed down some pizza, amidst revelling England fans who’d travelled to see the football team beat Spain in Valencia, and boarded our flight back to Gatwick and home to Brighton.

Our brief foray to Southern Europe and warmer climes was over.
