## Day 1

## Day 2

## Day 3

## Day 4

This afternoon we needed to bait the dogs. Their contraception needs renewing. Given this is a healthy, beautiful pack with good genes, and given that this is a critically endangered creature, preventing them from reproducing is abhorrent to me. I could understand if the dogs had bad genes; say the alpha male and female were siblings or cousins; but they aren’t, and their pups would greatly benefit the dwindling population. Alas; keeping and managing wild dogs is hard enough. They eat a lot of game and they escape the reserve a lot; more dogs means more dead herbivores, and animals are money; and it means more escapees too – which means more compensation payouts if they decide to eat a community goat. So the reserve contracepts them; the pragmatic perspective is that, “at least they have a home”. Many wild dogs are homeless, no reserve wants them.

Dane, a field technician at ZRR, joins us to help with the baiting. I’m still scanning this afternoon; responsibility on my shoulders. We return to Bayete corner, via Rhino River, searching for the pack. It doesn’t take us long to find them; they’re resting on a game path.

Our bait is a young impala, the carcass a little old, not yet starting to smell; Dane ties a rope – one end through bone, the other to the truck, then drops it off behind. We approach the dogs slowly, dragging the impala behind us, through the dead grey grass until it snags on a tree. The dogs are nervous, they’re unsure how to respond – it looks like food, they peer inquisitively, but then they run, disappearing into the thicket. We know they fed this morning, perhaps they weren’t hungry.

We don’t give up; I continue to scan, tweaking volume, gain and direction – trying to detect imperceptible differences in beep volumes to work out their location and distance from us. For a long time their signal is a moving one, but they don’t move left or right or further away – probably playing as usual.

Eventually it shifts; the signal goes from 9 to 8, to 7, did something bump them? Are they hunting? We give chase, right to the border fence, where we find the answer. The pack is surrounding a lone male impala, its head is stuck between the electric fence. The dogs have forced it into the electrics where it’s being jolted with thousands of volts every 10 seconds, it twitches every time. One dog tries to grab at it but it gets a shock too; they choose to wait it out, lying down nearby as the impala is tortured.

It writhes and wriggles and eventually breaks free. But he’s weak. It desperately sprints along the fence line and the pack give chase. We follow and find a similar scene; the impala is again trapped, its legs caught in the fence, its body writhing with every shock; the dogs resting nearby. Zap, zap, every struggle is hard to watch, and as time goes by the impala fights less and less, until it stops moving; electrified to death – it got the chair, natural predators, an unnatural death. An easy kill for the dogs, its understandable why they like this corner.

The dogs aren’t hungry though, they return to rest and play. We give up on baiting them tonight, but this fresh impala kill will make the perfect bait tomorrow morning. Dane retrieves it from the fence and loads it onto the truck, its empty eyes staring at us, head propped up against the tailgate. We drive home in the rain.

## Day 5

This morning we left at 3:45am, the overcast clouds had cleared; it’d be a sunny day. We left with two impala in tow; after last night’s unsuccessful baiting attempt we’d try again. The truck was probably covered with ticks by now. With Dani and Dane upfront, we hurtled south to Bayete corner, trying to reach the dogs before they left on their morning hunt.

I’d be scanning again, my fellow vollies dubbed me “scan man”, which meant I had the responsibility of pointing us in the right direction. By our arrival the dogs had gone, a faint signal in their wake, it pointed at 12 o’clock, along the fence line. We followed and it quickly grew stronger, 2 o‘clock, 3 o’clock, “slow down”. While I’m pinpointing with the faintest of beeps and the most delicate of gain tweaks, Sylvia spots them; all five running past us, back the way we came, and soon out of sight again.

Again I needed to work the telemetry; where were they going? What direction? How far away? Where should we bait them? At the corner we picked up a strong signal for WDF2, and found her ahead of us, besides the electric fence. Now was our chance. Dane hopped off the back, pulled out the male impala and tied it to a tree. She watched us, curious, nose sniffing the air. We backed up and waited.

This dog was hesitant; they hadn’t been baited in a year, and she seemed unsure. We reversed further and it drew her in, soon she was feeding. It must’ve tasted good; quickly she left to find the others, and within a few moments the pack were feeding.

The habituation is to make darting the dogs easier, which means getting a truck to within 25m of them. As they fed Dani turned her engine on and off, revved the engine, and edged closer. The aim was to make them feel comfortable with the truck nearby.

It didn’t take them long to finish, and the pack quickly resumed their usual activity; play. I’ve never seen dogs play just as much as these five. They leap about, wrestle on their hind legs, nip each others heels, grab each other in headlocks, twitter with delight and run around in circles – like tag is their favourite game. They’re a wonder to watch.

Our job was done by 7am; we had a quick coffee, some rusks; a tick removal session and returned to camp – all desperate to shower, do some laundry and clean the truck; a perfect time for the water to stop.

In the afternoon we focused on camera traps, travelling the length of the reserve to replace SD cards and batteries. The closest was besides camp, we’d left an unused bait beside a trap to see what was nearby – the bait was eaten but the camera wasn’t working, and the tracks had been washed away. With bitter disappointment we tugged at the rope holding the carcass, holding our breath from the stench of death. Other cameras were on cheetah scent marking trees and we traversed bumpy unused roads to reach them.

The weather when we left was beautiful, a very hot sun with a clear sky – shorts and t-shirt attire. As we approached camera 2 things had changed; the south-westerly wind was hot, but above it, from another direction, a cold wind brewed and with it came large dark clouds. Showers threatened, huge globules of water splattered briefly, thunder rumbled and while changing camera 3 lightning lit up the sky. “You saw lightning? Aww no”, Dani said, that’s the trigger, “we have to go home guys”, it’s too dangerous being on the back of an open metal truck in a thunderstorm.

We rushed back, the wind at our backs, a curtain of rain behind us. Ahead, the largest full moon of the year came up above the mountains – a magnificent sight, visible until the storm consumed it.

## Day 6

Despite the storms and the gale force winds, storms which brought little rain to this drought ridden region, the temperature this morning was still warm. For once we didn’t need hats and fleeces. Paweł scanned for the dogs and we headed south-east once again, to Bayala corner; the dog’s favourite place. They’d already left when we arrived. We got a brief visual on the fence line before they headed inland, taking a route tricky to follow. Tourists reported seeing them, but for us they stayed out of sight. Still, that’s 8 out of 8 dog sessions with visuals, not bad.

Post coffee and muesli rusks, we headed further south, deep into Bayete, to the dry riverbed, in search of a camera trap. This part of the park remains verdant; the trees are green and plants grow beneath them. It’s a leopard hotspot and our eyes scanned the trees as we travelled. In week 7 of 8 I am still yet to see one of these elusive cats. “57 images, yes!”, Dani shouted, as we kept an eye out for opportunist leopards and nearby lions.

ZRR has admin days meaning no evening session tonight. This gave my back and leg spasms a welcomed break. All this truck riding, spine bashing, arm bruising travel 8 hours a day has taken its toll.

## Day 7 - Counting buffalo and a wild dog hunt

A later start this morning, 5:30am; which turned out to be 6am after we manually filled up the truck with diesel. Today we’d be doing the unenviable and difficult task of monitoring buffalo herds at feeding sites. The buffalo are suffering in the drought, many are losing weight, many are dying. Our aim was to count the buffalo feeding, sex and age them, and assess their condition.

To sex and age a buffalo it all comes down to the horns; are they curved, do they hang, is there a big “boss” on top? To be honest, we found it difficult enough just counting them; first there were 17, then 24, then 27; when they left we got a final correct total of 30. Our estimates of sub adults and juveniles, males and females, will have a big margin of error.

At the site there were wildebeest too, to add to the confusion of brown bodies. So too were many warthog, crested and helmeted guinea-fowl, black-capped bulbuls, golden breasted buntings, and skittish vervet monkeys – all clearly wary of our white truck.

The herbivores are being fed sugar cane, which the buffalo calmly munched, their jaws moving sideways, masticating the tasty dish. Many of the workers we’ve seen putting out the cane also chew it. I’d like to try some. After eating the buffalo collapsed onto their side for a massage; oxpeckers and warthogs went to work, chewing off the ticks, and whatever other nutritious bits they could find. The buffalo seemed to enjoy it.

We stayed at the site for a couple of hours, and the star of the show was a little black-backed jackal. The first jackal I’ve seen, it zipped about the yellow straw, nibbling at bits, threatening warthog, bravely chasing impala, scaring off monkeys, hunting birds, and finally settling down in the food to have a good roll around.

Dani got reports that two female cheetah had been spotted nearby. They’re yearlings who’ve recently left their mother and our ID kit needs better pictures. After coffee and rusks we went in search, driving up and down the roads in the general area they were last seen – there’s no collars, which makes things difficult. Rather smuggly I was first to spot them, two cheetah lying in the dirt, resting. The cheetah didn’t do much more than that. They looked up occasionally, twisted a little, but didn’t stand for us to get ID photos. We had to leave them to drop off Babs and Sylvia in town, they were going to St Lucia.

### Hunting by the fence

With Sylvia and Babs now in St Lucia, the three of us, Pawel, Dani and me, headed out in search of the dogs once again. The drive started well, a single scan gave us a good location, and on the way we passed elephant, rhino and buffalo. One particular white rhino stood square in the road, not wanting to leave it – we edged closer and it stood its ground, we waited patiently. Finding the dogs got easier too, a tour guide radio’d in their exact location and we headed straight there; they’d travelled along the fence line, from Bayala corner down to Bayete. From the dirt track we could see the gathering of safari jeeps.

The dogs were pacing up and down the fence looking for an unsuspecting impala to kill; F2 lagging behind doing her own thing, as usual, she’s so weird. Perhaps she wants to disperse, but without any other dogs nearby what can she do? The troubles of small fenced reserves.

The dogs caught sight of an impala herd and ran off hunting them, we hugged the fence line and slowly followed until we reached a corner. Here were two male impala, they hadn’t fled when the dogs gave chase, and while the dogs weren’t in sight, these impala were dicing with death, “they’re screwed” I said. The dogs could easily surround them and force them into the electrics.

Sure enough we spotted the pack coming back up the hill, their herd chase had been fruitless and they were resuming fence patrols. The impala watched, but didn’t flee. A dog sees one and starts running, a single impala heads along the fenceline and down the hill,  out to safety. The dog doubles back and now the rest of the pack are here too – the lone last impala turns to run, an impulse, but it’s got nowhere to go, it’s in a corner. It takes a leap of madness and launches itself directly into the fence in a desperate attempt to escape, its horns get caught and we hear the familiar _zzzap_ noise – it’s being electrocuted, its body jolts. Wriggling and writhing it breaks free, leaping away from the dogs, it runs by the back of the truck and down the hill. The whole pack sprints behind it, gaining on it with each impala jump. Just over the hill, just out of sight, but in front of tourists, they make the kill. We arrive to the sounds of tourists chatting loudly about how amazing that was, below us in a drainage area the dogs are almost done eating.

## Day 8 - Day of the dead

Our 11th dog session was much like those before it. We headed south, got a signal, followed the signal and found the pack of 5 sitting on the fence line. Their patterns were becoming predictable. We arrived too late for their morning hunt, presumably they’d already eaten – that or they simply weren’t hungry. F2 was being her weird self again, while the pack rested she paced up and down the fence, looking out across the road to Thanda reserve; we couldn’t see what interested her – some nyala, a kill, perhaps some vagrant wild dogs? Who knows? Her behaviour is so odd.

A dead impala lay on the roadside, it’d died from exhaustion overnight – the dogs sniffed at it, they nibbled at its groin (taking the gonads), but let it be. We needed to continue our wild dog habituation by doing another baiting; we could use this impala. After coffee, rusks, and once all the safari jeeps were gone, Dani dragged it by the legs to the truck, we took the scrawny male home with us, along with the copious little black ticks that called him home.

We had an eye, or a nose, for spotting dead animals today. This dead impala, shortly followed by a dead zebra – partly eaten by vultures; a dead warthog on the roadside; vultures chewed a leg of nyala; wildebeest and buffalo skeletons amidst the thicket; a poor grey duiker dead too. This is Africa. This is what drought looks like. Scrawny, exhausted, dry, brown, desolate and dead. ZRR needs rain desperately.

In the afternoon, ticks now all over the truck, a stream of clear _impala_ juice running under the seats, we set off with our impala to bait the dogs. We arrived in good time, they were resting where we’d left them. Dane met us there. Once the dogs had woken, stretched and set off on their patrol, we got to work. Dane cut off a leg, tied rope to it, and we dragged it behind, spreading the impala scent as we drove. Upwind from them we tied the carcass to a tree and drove away to watch what would happen. The aim is to get as close as possible while they feed.

It wasn’t the most successful bait; after a few minutes they found it, they nibbled, they tasted, and then they left – all before we could respond. Only F2 stayed by the carcass, she seemed content to eat it. Endo, Indy, 101 and M1 wandered out of sight, presumably hunting. We left them and the carcass and called it a night.

We saw rhino, buffalo, elephant, 6 ostrich and our first hippos on the drive home.

## Day 9 - Wash out

The rain woke us up; a waterfall from the broken guttering. At long last ZRR was getting some rain, proper rain, a downpour. We left later, at 7am, to avoid the worst of it; our aim – to count and sex buffalo again. The roads are mud paths, and they’d turned to slosh – the 4x4 slipped and skidded on the tracks, mud flying everywhere, the white truck turning brown. All the lodges were closed, no driving allowed; trucks and jeeps skidding about would destroy the roads, and someone would end up stuck. This limited our choice of feeding site – the first was empty, no buffalo; the second had buffalo, a herd of 40 strong but they didn’t like us being there – a bold female pushed us away, walking towards us, staring us down, making us leave. We couldn’t count them if they didn’t want to be counted. The third and final site was empty, save a 100 or so warthog that scattered when we arrived. We called it a day and returned to camp for coffee.

There was a silver lining to this trip; I had my best black rhino sighting. With so few vehicles around perhaps the usually shy rhino felt emboldened to approach a road. The dehorned beast stopped when he saw us, should he cross? He stepped forwards, then back, “no, maybe further up the road … should I cross here? No, further still …”, his thoughts were obvious. Eventually he crossed a long way ahead of us, then resumed is path towards wherever it was he was going. I didn’t think something so powerful and dangerous could be so endearing.

In the afternoon there was more rain, the roads were muddy and slippery; with Sylvia and Babs back we tried to do another buffalo count. Our first feeding site was empty, the second looked promising – and we would have stayed had it not been for one particular female cow who didn’t take kindly to us. Head down, staring, she walked at us, pushing us back, reversing up and around the hill in the slippery mud, 4x4 engaged. We tried to get her to back down, and it looked like we might, until 3 more buffalo stood besides her. Fine we’ll leave. Elsewhere, another feeding site, we found 40 odd buffalo, but we couldn’t count or sex them, they were too far away and all sitting down.

## Day 10 - New cheetah and a failed bait

At 5am (not 5:30am as I’d heard and had to rush), later than planned because of heavy rain and thunder (ZRR is getting some much needed rain, hooray!), we set out to find the dogs and bait them again. This would be bait number 3. We headed back to Rhino River and assumed the dogs would be near the fence line, where we last left them, we met Dane there with a dead impala.

I was scanning, but the receiver didn’t pick up a strong signal – I believed them to be behind us, away from the fence, more to the centre of the reserve – that’s why the signal was week, and I double-checked for back-signal a number of times. Dani disagreed, and we went the opposite direction, staying near the fence. We did pick up what looked like a good direction, but we found nothing, and on the muddy roads there were no signs of fresh wild dog tracks. They weren’t here, but we kept circling. Grumpy from hunger, without breakfast because I rushed, I let Dani do the scanning, we didn’t find them, I don’t think we came close. Probably the most frustrating session I’d had. But I cheered up once I’d had a rusk and some coffee.

Our afternoon session was abandoned when new priorities came in; a truck was arriving with two new cheetah. A male coalition, they’d been seen and darted in another reserve this morning. There’d long been a plan to exchange two cheetah from that reserve with ZRR, to improve genetic diversity. The uncollared cheetah had been spotted that morning and an opportunistic attempt was made to dart and capture them, they were successful.

Dani woke us up from our midday nap, “we’re going, going now, must leave now”.  In the truck we hurtled through the mud to the predator boma. Inside we put our dead impala, the one we’d had for the dogs. The truck with the cheetah arrived, two sleeping cheetah lay on the back of the bucky, face masks covering their eyes. They drove straight into the boma and lifted up each cheetah, the vet administered an antidote to their sedative and quickly left them there.

We stayed and waited for the new cheetah to wake up; they were dozy and confused, like waking up after a bad night out. They couldn’t walk straight, they kept falling over, the drugs still disabling parts of them. One tried to run and skidded about in the mud, before making it to the boma edge. When they were both awake they called to each other, a high pitched clicking cat noise, as if cheetah weren’t endearing enough. They both fed on the impala.

We didn’t have a session after that, instead we watched Blood Lions on the volunteer laptop.

## Day 11 - Baiting the storm

At 3:45am there were more thunderstorms, and more rain. I stayed home and rested, the others left at 4:45am – they didn’t find the dogs but did see a black rhino, and double checked on the cheetah in the boma. I was thankful for my sleep.

In the evening we all left in search of the wild dogs again, a fresh impala bait in tow, clear skies all around, a balmy 30C, the warm air on the truck doing little to cool us down; the muddy puddle splashing us in the face – that helped. We began with a little bit of luck; near a fence line we found a sleeping cheetah resting under the shade of an acacia. It wasn’t moving any time soon so we couldn’t ID or sex it. We left swiftly, the dogs had been hard to find recently and we needed to habituate them, it might take a while.

As predicted, our telemetry gave us confusing signals. A vague signal towards the corner of the reserve, but when we arrived – nothing. I climbed up a rhino guard post, receiver in pocket, aerial balanced on my shoulder; getting up high to try and find a signal. The metal hut at the top doesn’t help, but I did get a signal for one of the dogs in the direction we’d been looking. We were all so very confused. Telemetry can be an art form at times, but now we were doubting our equipment, we swapped aerials, cables and receivers but got the same story. Out of desperation we headed up and down the fence line, nothing, no signal in any direction.

Out of nowhere we got a signal, from nothing we started hearing strong beeps, from M1 and F2. Pedal down, wheels throwing wet mud, we rushed towards it, Dani scanning as Megan drove. Left, 9 o’clock, stronger, wait, left again, keep going. I’ve lost it. Back again, reverse, turn in the dirt, take a right, they’re here somewhere, but the signal dies again. We were now very close to a dry riverbed, perhaps the deep bed was blocking their signal – on a hunch we took the little used road to the edge, the skies darkening, a big storm cloud beginning to dominate the skies, we found them.

All five dogs were by the river, they’d been walking in and out, their signal, coming and going and bouncing. The electrics up-ahead were sparking, sounds like they’d driven something into it recently. Their bellies didn’t look full, and there was no blood – they were still hungry. They disappeared again, we guessed their direction and followed their path along the river, cutting in ahead of them, upwind.

It was quickly getting dark and we could hear rumblings of thunder. It felt too late to bait the dogs, but without us really trying the dogs had caught the scent of our dead impala. All five followed the truck, heads held high, sniffing with anticipation, twittering at the prospect of food. We worked quickly – Megan drove on ahead as we prepped the bait, tying the rope through the antelope’s leg bone, Dani and Paweł hopped out and quickly tied the impala to a fever tree, the dogs were on us, they were watching, eager, ears up, interested. Back on the truck, reversing out quickly, the dogs rushed in and immediately began to feed. From a short distance I listened to the twittering sounds, the dogs were happy, in a frenzy; dark now, their bodies illuminated by the odd flash of lightning, the twittering broken by a clap of thunder. We edged closer, the dogs didn’t mind. Through binoculars I could make out their shapes in the darkness, tugging at the leg, trying to pull the carcass away.

Sitting in the dark with the dogs, listening to the nearby storm, the air windless and humid – it was wonderful. Bats were flying above us, and an occasional crested francolin let out a blood curdling cry. Success tasted sweet, and we headed home through the warm night.

The storm was epic. Every few seconds the clouds dazzled us as bolts of light shot out in all directions. Soon enough it was upon us, lightning above our heads, flashes so bright we couldn’t see in the dark. And then the rain came. An epic storm with epic rain, the raindrops were enormous, at 40km per hour they hit us like hailstones. In seconds we were drenched through, rivers poured from my wet weather coat, my bush pants saturated, I sat in a puddle. Pelted by rain, so thoroughly wet, yet warm, we laughed at the absurdity. “I think it’s raining” I said, water flowing down my face, the drips tasted like soap.

## Day 12 - Feeding cheetah and counting buffalo

After many days of rain, just what the park had needed, we had a break; perfect clear skies and sunshine. There was a gorgeous sunrise, and for much of the day the light was perfect for photography; it’s a shame then that we would be counting buffalo all day. But this is conservation and not a safari; the work needs to be done and that’s the priority.

We started with the first of our bi-daily cheetah boma checks. Today they needed feeding, we met Dane at the boma and he brought with him the skinny carcass of a male impala, hardly any meat on it. The method of feeding is nuanced; drive as close to the electric fence as you can, lift the gutted bleeding carcass above your heads, and launch it over the fence top – watching it crash into a heap on the other side, hopefully not catching and shorting the electrics. Then we resumed our regular tasks; circling the boma, looking for problems, tracks, digging, escape attempts and checking the electrics with a voltmeter, and filling up the water trough. We waited for a long time just out of sight in hopes that the cheetah might come and eat the food we’d given them. But when we returned they hadn’t touched it. I probably wouldn’t either. These cheetah will have to get used to skinny food. (In the afternoon it was still untouched).

We had coffee and rusks with Dani and Megan near a feeding site and then attempted to count, sex and age a small herd of buffalo; we counted 47 individuals – waiting for the herd to cross in front of us to avoid double counting.

Back at camp the sun was shining, birds were active in the trees and I relaxed outside. Weavers, barbets and cape glossy starlings moved in the trees above me, and with a glass of crisp white wine I watched the day go by. This trip would soon be over and it’d be months before I felt the warm sun like this again.

Dane joined us in the evening with the hope that an extra pair of eyes, and some more expertise, would make the buffalo count easier. We rocked up at a feeding site to find over 100 buffalo; 107 to be precise, but not accurate. In the hot sun, for 2 hours, we attempted to sex and age them; us volunteers managed about 30, Dane and Dani about 40. It was hard work, staring into the low sun, assessing the hairiness of a boss, or the curvature of horns, or the thickness of a hide – the buffalo always moving. Besides us we also watched zebra cavort; young foals pranced about, a herd squabbled. Wildebeest came and went. White rhino bossed the best feeding patches, their young sleeping in the shade.

Babs’s keen eyes spotted a single lonesome buffalo calf. Over the two hours we hadn’t seen it feed, and we couldn’t see its mother. More worrying, it stayed on the floor, and each time it tried to stand it struggled and gave up. Because of the drought many cows have been unable to feed their young, their udders dry up and the calves are abandoned. Sometimes management can step in before that happens, before the calf is too far gone, they can rescue the calf and care for it in a boma; we considered that now. With some rope we’d reverse in, catch the calf, blindfold it, and rush it to the herbivore boma where others already are. But the light was fading now, we needed rope and more hands, and management was already stretched – caring for the existing buffalo, managing feeding sites, feeding the cheetah, etc. Perhaps they’d try another day, we wouldn’t know.

### Night of the creepy crawlies

After rain comes bugs, and ZRR was beginning to resemble a scene out of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (perhaps that’s an exaggeration), on the drive back we got pelted with swarms of flying ants, their discarded wings littered the roads. We closed all the windows, and every few seconds a dung beetle would bash into it, craving the lights, millipedes were wandering around all over the floor.

It was while prepping the sausage and mash that Paweł called us; a spider in his room. A type of tarantula, a baboon spider, was running around under his bed. We caught it in a plastic bowl, releasing it outside. It was then that we stumbled on a large bark scorpion waiting by the door, a wasp attached to its head, parasitising it. Dung beetles flew around us as we ate dinner, then we went on the search for more exciting bugs; a huge moth in the outside corridor, and just as we were about to sleep I found a small brown snake, about half a metre long, resting near the door. Probably a harmless house snake but we kept a respectable distance just in case.

## Day 13 - Leopard cameras

For my penultimate morning, to my disappointment, we weren’t going to track the dogs. Instead it was a late start, 5:30am, and we would be working on the camera traps. A somewhat lacklustre ending to an epic trip.

Two cameras were straightforward; unlocking the camera, changing the SD, changing the batteries, taking a test photo, though they each had their own surprise. The first one disappointed me, an hour earlier, in this exact spot, if we’d left at normal time, we might have seen a brown hyena, in daylight no less – the camera picked it up perfectly. The second surprise came when I opened a camera trap door, behind the camera I found a web, an orb of eggs and a beautiful brown widow spider; I tried not to disturb it when I put the camera back in.

We stopped for coffee at one of the feeding sites; zebra, wildebeest, waterbuck and rhino fed while we gorged on instant coffee and Spar’s own brand rusks.

The third camera was a new one, we met up with Matt from Leopard Mountain and he showed us a spot where they’d seen leopards mating (!). Just around the corner from the road, along a well used game trail we hammered in two new camera posts – amongst the feathery remains of an eaten emerald spotted dove. ZRR are hoping to build up an identikit of the different leopards in the reserve, and this is one of the first steps. A nice side-on image of a leopard walking past would be ideal.

This was my last chance to see a leopard on my 8 week trip. I tried hard, scanning all the trees with my binos, looking for tracks; nothing. I’ll have to come back to see the last of my _big 5_. 500 hours on the back of a truck in KZN parks and no leopard sighting – this is how hard they are to see here.

It was however nice to see that the river was flowing after all the rain we’d had. It’ll probably flow for a few days and then dry up again. There too was a lovely black and yellow millipede, and a dark-backed weaver bird.

## Day 14 - One last session

Today was home time, my 12 weeks away from home were up. Later I would have my bags packed, take the minibus from Mkhuze down to Richards Bay, fly to JoBurg and soon enough be landing back in the UK. But I had one more session; an early one too, leaving at 3:45am to find the dogs.

It didn’t start well; rain and a flat tyre. In the dark we propped up the car, pulled out the spare from underneath and swapped it – an unexpected delay. The rain let–up by the time we left, replaced with a new kind of weather; fog. My last _night drive_, I shone Paweł’s torch into the darkness, hoping to catch the eyes of an aardvark or a hyena, I found only ground-level cloud and impala.

We hadn’t seen the dogs in a few days, they could have moved anywhere. I tried to get signal from the usual high points – nothing. We gambled and returned to where we’d seen them last. At last, a faint signal – they were near the fence line again. Foot down, we rushed there.

ZRR is looking different now to when I arrived, after 5 days of rain the drought is beginning to be replaced with life; little green plants are sprouting from the brown soil, small green leaves are appearing on the trees, the dust is replaced with mud. It’s a wonderful sight. I hope it can continue. Perhaps when I’m gone there might be day after day of torrential rain.

After a couple of false turns we got sight of the dogs; F2 was up ahead by herself again, resting. The remaining 4 in a group, watching her, taking her lead. She was resting so the dogs played. In front of the truck they wrestled, reared up on two legs and fought each other, playful attacks, running in circles, charging at each other; until the serious business of hunting began again. F2 got up and started moving away, the pack followed, we followed them.

They fanned out over the ground, walking in a row, they jogged along, looking for prey near the fence. We tagged along, the sixth member of the hunt. There no impala, no antelope, and soon F2 was stopping again to rest, and once more the pack played. They rolled around in the mud, they twittered and screeched, and they did so right besides our car. For over an hour we watched the dogs hunt, rest and play. The most perfect send off to an epic wildlife trip.

I had to love them and leave them; I had my last coffee and rusks besides the cheetah boma – one final check of the electrics, and that was it, save one surprise.

### Snakes

While loading the car with our bags and the two flat tyres that need fixing in town, we unearthed a snake. Beneath the tyre the snake had been sleeping, and now it was pissed. This small, brown snake curled up and looked at us, it unfurled and hissed with anger, we kept our distance. It was a mildly venomous herald snake; we went to get cameras for a better photo, but it disappeared. Rather than stumble into it, we hopped on the vehicle and left the reserve. Herds of impala were sitting, resting in the cold, I waved goodbye.

## Farewell

At the changeover point I found two of my first group, from iMfolozi, Philippine and Feline – we’d been WhatsApping throughout the 8 weeks – spies in all the reserves, we often knew what was happening before our monitors did. Now we were together one last time, so too were our monitors; Philippine had said goodbye to Hayden that morning, here in Mkhuze were PJ and Megan, and then at Phumula lodge we found Kelsey. Perfectly choreographed farewells, what luck.

And now my time with Wildlife Act is over. 4 weeks in North Island, Seychelles, which feels so long ago. 2 weeks in iMfolozi, 2 in Tembe, 2 in Mkhuze and now the last 2 in ZRR. Each reserve and monitor is different, each with a different focus, each relentlessly dedicated to the conservation and protection of endangered species.

It’s been a truly life changing experience; rewarding, exciting, thrilling, tiring, joyful and painful. I made so many friends and laughed so many times. I worked hard, I learnt the smell of death, I discovered the incredibly tough problems conservation deals with every day; poaching, climate change, habitat destruction, lack of space, lack of corridors, genetic diversity and disease. At times they feel insurmountable, but every life saved, every life protected, is a victory.

Wildlife Act, along with the wild dog advisory group, are changing the fortunes of the wild dogs; they work tirelessly to protect them, to manage the gene pool, to find them safe and suitable homes, to convince reserves to house them, to raise awareness of them; they do the hard work to keep their numbers growing. I am so thankful to have been part of that, to have contributed my time and money. May the work continue, and may the dogs thrive.
