From our [trip to Cadaqués](http://www.sam-and-paul.com/2010/10/cadaques-spain/), the return route to Barcelona took us a different way. Up at 7am, checked out by 8am, with breakfast wrapped in napkins, the hotel director dropped us at the bus station in his jeep. Adiós. On the Sarfa bus we went up and around the mountain roads again, bus swaying left to right to left, perilously close to the barriers and sheer drops, shades of the [Lesvos tour bus](http://www.sam-and-paul.com/2008/09/two-weeks-in-molyvos-in-lesbos-greece/4/) we’d been on. Sounds of kids getting travel sick in the back left us listening to the “500 days of summer” soundtrack. We were on our way to Figueres; the bus arrived late, and we had a mad dash sprint to the train, luggage in tow. Sam bought the tickets, I used the loo. Then down the steps, under the platform, up again and onto the train, a full 30 seconds to spare.

Two more hours going south, past Girona, to Barcelona--shut eye opportunity impeded by a Spanish woman that liked to talk, a lot. From Sants Estació we took the metro to Hospital Clinic, then through the afternoon heat to Hotel Center, hotel number two. Hello Barcelona!

In the cool, air conditioned room, with its dark brown wooden décor, tiled and glistening bathroom, thick curtains and huge beds, we recovered, in four star luxury.

Soon enough, Sam was tired of relaxing and wanted to do something. “Can we try out this Lonely Planet walking tour?”. Why not. Not wanting to waste any more of the day, we grabbed some lunch from El Fornet and took the metro down to Plaça de Catalunya, the tour started with Las Ramblas.

Las Ramblas is packed with shopping stalls, pet stalls and street performers; from terrible Zorros and painted silver statues (chatting during their break), to perfectly executed floating genies that left crowds gasping. Dodgy looking men sold squeaky plastic mouthpieces and paranoid for our valuables, we hugged our bags and pockets tightly.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-147.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-147.jpg)

First stop, Palau Güell, an early Gaudí project, closed for renovations. Then to Plaça de Sant Jaume a large open square with central fountain and surrounding eateries. Now in the Barri Gòtic quarter we meandered through thin streets, round to the catedral (not the only cathedral in BCN under scaffolding) and Iglesia Santa María del Mar. We didn’t go in, a wedding was going on, we instead sat on the wall nearby, watching the smartly dressed passers by, and the quirky artist that appeared to be a misanthrope. We stopped again at the Plaça del Rei, a quiet enclosed square with steps perfectly placed for seating--here I strained to photograph those sitting near us in an artistic way.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-148.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-148.jpg)

Round the back of the cathedral we paused for strawberry and raspberry ice creams, as another performer created huge soapy bubbles, leaving the air smelling of washing up liquid.

The tour continued, taking us past the Museo de Picasso, we didn’t go in, then up to the spectacular Palau de la Música Catalana. We took a small detour to a tea shop (how could we not?), I think we were there for about 45 minutes, smelling and trying different blends. Only Sam could go on holiday to Spain and come back with three bags of freshly packed tea. Oolong and Jasmine, apple and green tea, and another one that smelt rather horrible, so I’ve apparently forgotten what it’s called.

By the Picasso museum we stopped at the BCN design hub, dHUB, for their free wallpaper exhibition. Sounds dull, certainly wasn’t. Exhibits included a post-it note wall, a rucked up roll of solid paper which formed a stylish shelf, textured papers, paper that changed based on temperature and designs that flowed around wall objects, like sockets and lamps.

Our hotel sat very close to the excellent and widely recommended tapas bar and restaurant, Cerveceria Catalana, which I can neither spell nor pronounce. It is always busy. You can either sit at a table, with a menu, and order dishes as and when you please, or more excitingly, sit at the bar where all the freshly prepared food is laid out in front of you. Then you just point, and keep eating and ordering until your bellies are full or your wallets empty. On this occasion we did a bit of both, while waiting for our table we ordered from the seafood bar; yummy razor clams in garlic, before going to our table. Plate after plate kept coming, as we drank our jug of Sangria. The fried baby squids, complete with cute tentacles, were delicious, not to mention the date, bacon and cheese flute, that I managed to get Sam tasting AND liking.

<div class="menu">

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-162.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-162.jpg)

We shared tips on menu choices and Barca trips with the tables either side; a slightly drunken (three jugs of Sangria?) American-Asian now living in China, trying to chat up some Japanese girls on one side, and two English girls on a long girly weekend of sightseeing and good food, on the other.

<!--nextpage-->

First Sunday of the month, and our intention was to visit the Picasso museum, because it was free. We had a bit of a lie in though, and didn’t leave the hotel until 11:30am, stopping for breakfast at Crusto, a place recommended on foursquare for their delicious Pain au Chocolat. The guy that served us was a perfectionist, and the cappuccinos came with beautiful froth designs on them. I had the croissant, but Sam tried their delicious ensaïmada, which soon became my breakfast choice as well.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-164.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-164.jpg)

We fancied seeing the inside of the Palau de Música Catalana, not wanting to pay 12 euros for a tour, we asked about performances, one opera/flamenco show was on tonight, for 40 euros each, but we had to come back at 7:30pm to buy tickets, so we didn’t bother. We got into the town centre at midday-ish, and by then we realised everyone else had had the same idea about Picasso. The queue ran around the block and wasn’t really moving, so we didn’t go in, and by now we were a little bothered that the day wasn’t going to plan.

We were out during the hottest part of the day, foolish really. So we stopped at Parc de la Ciutadella to chill out and cool down; sitting on the bench by the lake, we slept, read, and watched families and lovers paddle around on old wooden boats, like dodgems in slow motion. By the magnificent fountains and man-made waterfall, talented puppeteers performed a double act, one puppet playing piano, the other singing, and on the bandstand tap dancers took the stage.

Back at the Picasso museum, we found the queue to be just as long. Clearly, we weren’t going to be seeing the artist’s early works. Instead we returned to dHUB, and had a late lunch (vegetable tart and potato tortilla, with an excellent almond chocolate dessert). The gift shop kept us amused, with cleverly designed vases, hooks, lamps and umbrellas packaged into bottles.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-173.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-173.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-174.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-174.jpg)

The Picasso queue was still too long. Instead we delved into the world of 3D fabrication technology, another fascinating dHub exhibition. Amongst red walls and spot lights were chairs created from motion capture drawings, synthesised spiky speakers that mimic your music taste and lemon zesters in curious shapes. A video taught us the benefits of 3D printing concrete, and we’re now swotted up on cell by cell 3D printing of biological structures, one day it could be organs, but at the moment it’s limited to skin tissues. Got to take it one step at a time. From the mother’s womb, 3D foetus models can be built and with 3D printers a life size replica produced, freakish to say the least. In the up-lit whitewashed room were students’ fabricating robot experiments; bots that could build structures from cardboard using solar power, and devices that created sculpture using swarm theory. Our minds were blown.

To the hotel and back via the metro’s L4 line and Passeig de Gràcia station, we ventured again to Barri Gòtic for our evening meal, this time indulging in a concoction of flavours from Pla, a so called “den of inventive cooking”. In a dimly lit grotto, with Air’s “Moon Safari”, Gas (a band) and a touch of free jazz setting the vibe, the waitress explained the specials in great depth and recommended an excellent wine.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   OCTOPUS CARPACCIO with fresh tomato, avocado and pine nuts cream, a touch of wasabi and another of paprika
*   BRAISED IBERIAN PORK FILLET mutabal aubergine mille-feuille, a hazelnut sauce and a dried apricot marmelade....( we recomend it rare )
*   GRILLED DESALTED COD, Idiazábal cheese, spinach, ratatouille and a very little honey
</div>

Pla cleverly seated everyone by language, good for the waitresses that couldn’t speak English, but landing us in the middle of three brash American tables. Although entertaining (and it’s hard to be annoyed when you’re laughing inside), hearing about the real estate lawyer’s main course that was too small, killed the romantic mood.

My soup of the day, pumpkin, was poured over the seafood mousse and shiitake mushroom in front of me, and Sam couldn’t turn up another opportunity for seafood; Octopus carpaccio with wasabi, perfectly presenting the taste of Octopus without any of the toughness. 

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-198.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-198.jpg)

Sam’s Iberian pork was divine, and I was filled with food envy; my Cod was nice, but it was just Cod, and I ought to have made a better choice. But wow, that pork, with the nut sauce, this is how pork should be.

Complementary grappa pushed us over the tipsy boat.

On Monday we didn’t make the same mistake, with ensaïmada’s from Crusto in hand, we were queuing for La Sagrada Família before 9am, ready for a day of Gaudí. With audio guide hanging around our necks, top notch headphones sitting uncomfortably on our ears, and Canon camera primed for photo opportunities, we dialled 1 and started the tour. “Welcome to La Sagrada Família...”.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-201.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-201.jpg)

In front of us was a façade depicting Christ’s death, barren and bone-like. The sculptures highlighted events leading up to the crucifixion, our personal in-ear tour guide pointed out the important details; alpha and omega over the door, Peter and the cock crowing, a hidden snake and a fossilised palm leaf in the stone. Looking up, a great bronze statue of Christ sat between the spires, resembling his ascension to heaven, amongst the cranes at work - still building this magnificent place.

Inside we were amazed by the ceiling, huge pillars rising to the roof and opening up like a canopy, light streaming in through newly set stained glass.

In the lift, up the rightmost spire, then out onto the roof, with its fabulous views across all of Barcelona. The sun was low enough to cast interesting shadows and the sky was dotted with the odd, perfectly fluffy, cloud, as if from a Thompson’s ad. The foundations for the central spire were laid, and realising the height this would reach, I was awestruck by the magnitude of the project.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-208.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-208.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-209.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-209.jpg)

We took the spiral staircase down, past Jesus on his ascent, and the balls of shiny fruit. Our tour continued, explaining the design of the windows to bring in the most light, and the differently coloured tree-like columns that support different weights. “The cathedral will seat a choir of over 1200”. It might be completed by 2040, we could come back when we’ve retired. A small exhibition explained how Gaudí used aspects of nature in his work.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-215.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-215.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-220.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-220.jpg)

Outside again, into the heat; basking in the sun stood the second façade, dedicated to Jesus’ birth and a celebration of life. With the tree of life above the stable scenes of Christ’s birth, the façade was overflowing with flora and fauna, from turtle and tortoise at the base, to flocks of birds at the top. Too many details for our audio tour guides to point out.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-323.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-323.jpg)

Beneath the cathedral lay the museum. Sketches show the masterpiece completed, but even the model replica was still being built. Gaudí’s tomb lay at the very back, in the dark, with a single spotlight pointing it out.

All told, we spent four hours here, and our audio guides were all out of breath and battery by the end. Sam couldn’t get enough, and whilst she explored the old school with its beamed roof, I sat on the dirt and found some nature to fascinate me; red ants and their desire to steal my sweet sweet pastry. I’m sure I could point out something poetic about big things and small things, as I sat beneath the spires watching insects, but I can’t think of anything right now.

Why do Spanish supermarkets all ask you to put your bags in a locker before shopping? Ours didn’t fit in. Meaning Sam shopped whilst I sat too close to the automatic doors and got my shoulder routinely bashed.

With picnic in tow, and cartons of tropical juice to refresh us (or make a mess of our clothes as we try and open them too forcefully *ahem*), part 2 of Gaudí day commenced: a trip to Park Güell.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-223.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-223.jpg)

The L3 metro line took us to Vallcarca, then a hill with lovingly built in escalators took us to one of the park’s side entrances. Now desperate for food, we etched out a shaded place to eat, it just happened to have spectacular views of the city and live music, like ska or reggae, but better, “we have a CD, it’s really good”, Microguagua they were called.

Packaged olives, brie, olive-bread and another healthy dose of saucisson perked us up. A pigeon circled us, never quite brave enough to nip in and grab anything. An American on the phone tried to explain how to find this place, but his group had climbed another hill entirely. Sitting beneath the pine tree, the odd bug falling on us, we stared out across the city. When we left the pigeon swooped in and hoovered up our crumbs.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-228.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-228.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-229.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-229.jpg)

Trekking up and down hills during the hottest part of the day, we still hadn’t learnt, and sure enough, we were exhausted again. Down the hill and towards the main entrance we found a broad open space. Street musicians with their hang drums created an air of tranquillity. We rested on the curvaceous bench and looked towards the city and two gatehouses. The smoothly tiled design sat perfectly against the curve of our backs; a cool surface, a view and ergonomic lumbar support - I could sit here all day.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-232.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-232.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-233.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-233.jpg)

The huge open space was built on a forest of columns, originally intended as a market place, and is guarded by a famous mosaic lizard. Rain water is collected and channelled to the creature, creating both a fountain and a drainage system.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-235.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-235.jpg)

On a quiet grassy verge we slept, this time beneath an olive tree. I read more of “One Day”, and gave Sam the chapter summaries, as if catching up with her old friends Dex and Em.

Inside Casa Museu Gaudí we explored rooms where Gaudí had once lived, though unlike Dali’s place, it was only a collection of furniture he had designed, scattered wherever it might fit, some original tiles and patterns had survived. Small cat and rat sculptures poked out from ugly red chairs, and a replica of La Sagrada Família’s keystone hung over the stairs. With our backpacks sitting uncomfortably on our front, the inviting ergonomic wooden chairs mocked us.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-237.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-237.jpg)

With the sun setting, we left the park to explore the streets of Gràcia and find one of the recommended eateries. Either we were too early or they were closed, but none of them appealed. We ended up stumbling on La Rita, a place popular with locals, where the food was hearty and looked fantastic. Going with a peculiar but regular Spanish menu item, we had meat and pasta as a starter; bolognese and cannelloni.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Spaghetti Bolognese
*   Meat Canneloni
*   Duck confit
*   Pork escalope

On Tuesday we scheduled a siesta break, we wouldn’t make the same mistake again! We couldn’t have known that at 3pm there would be a terrific thunderstorm. On the one day we prepare for the hot hot afternoon, it rains.

But I’m jumping ahead, that morning we made the short walk from our hotel to La Pedrera (Casa Milà), as if we hadn’t had enough Gaudí. Of course, we picked up sweet ensaïmadas from Crusto.

With another set of audio guides, we walked around the attic museum. It showcased Gaudí’s work, his techniques, Barcelona in the 1920s, nature’s influences and ergonomic furniture designs. The arching roof structure throughout was fascinating.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-241.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-241.jpg)

When Sam finished devouring every ounce of information we went up to the famous rooftop. Like undulating waves the roof flows, complementing the rippling grey façade and wrought iron balconies. Chimneys are elaborately sculpted, like smoke rising from the roof, capped with a soldier-like head. We tried out our improving photography skills, and we waited and waited for people to move out the way, mostly in vain.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-242.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-242.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-249.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-249.jpg)

Downstairs a traditional 1920s apartment was set up, with master bedroom, maids room, children’s room, etc. I left Sam with the Canon, and she captured some of the details beautifully.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-262.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-262.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-268.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-268.jpg)

Downstairs we continued having fun with the camera, Sam picked up a lot of textures and interesting patterns, and outside we tried to compose a shot of La Pedrera, a Gaudí-an street light and tree without getting the traffic and traffic lights in the way. We’d seen an image in the gift store and rather than pay 20 euros for it, we attempted to match it, which was fun in itself.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-274.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-274.jpg)

We stopped again at Cerveceria Catalana for lunch. Sitting at the bar we picked and plucked the tastiest looking tapas; from rich creamy three cheese melt to anchovies and peppers stuffed with tuna. There’s a reason it’s the most popular tapas bar in the city. Yum yum yum, and so exciting and social.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Potato and caper salad
*   Pepper stuffed with tuna
*   Mini breads with crab and gherkin
*   Anchovie, pepper, aubergine and olives on bread

Siesta time approached, and the second we reached our hotel room the heavens opened. So much for escaping the heat. As we we’re in the hotel, why not try out the rooftop jacuzzis? “It won’t be busy up there”. So, in our swimwear and in the rain, we watched Barcelona from our personal jacuzzi, as the rainclouds passed and the sun came out.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-288.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-288.jpg)

Fully recovered from all that heat, we set out again, mid-afternoon, to explore Manzana de la Discordia (the Apple of discord) on Passeig de Gràcia, namely Casa Batlló, Casa Lleó Morera and Casa Amatller. Then continuing south to Plaça de Catalunya. Not sure how to spend the rest of the day, we paid a quick trip to Barceloneta and the beach. The cable cars were closed because of high winds, and the Michelin recommended Torre d’Alta Mar looked a tempting food stop, but like the seating and views, the prices were sky high.

We stopped for Ice Cream (“of course Spar will have Ice Cream”), and after Sam had cleaned off the melted Feast from her new green dress, we took the metro back to Passeig de Gracia, enjoying the cool air-conditioned carriages, a far cry from London’s underground sauna system.

Before nipping back to the hotel to get changed for dinner, we stopped at Fundació Antoni Tàpies, another Modernista building with metal wire sculpture donning the roof. Inside a vast white room housed a Tàpies exhibition. Peculiar works of art; mounds of dirt stuck to walls, and rusting canvas with graffiti’d fractions. It was all a bit over our heads.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-303.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-303.jpg)

Our last night in Barcelona and I wanted to make it a special one, researching online (free hotel internet), I found, “El Túnel d’en Marc Palou”, a famous young Catalan chef that “combines creativity and family tradition”. Michelin recommended, and vying for a star, I called ahead and booked a table.

Picking up the last hotel umbrella, we headed out into the warm damp night, just missing the thunderstorm, which was now in the distance. After a walk through L’Eixample we reached the very quiet restaurant, was it open? Were we early?

The French waiter tried to seat us by the window, naively we sat further inside the restaurant, and to passers by the place would look empty. We had the restaurant, a waiter and a chef to ourselves for the whole night. Cosy and kinda cool, but also a bit unnerving.

<div class="menu">

### Menu

*   Gazpacho, chorizo and cheese biscuit apertifs
*   Foie gras terrine with with mango chutney and spice bread
*   Asparagus, poached egg, freshly-killed pork sausage and Parmesan cheese salad
*   Roast larded shoulder of kid with of sliced potatoes
*   Monkfish tournedos “suquet” with confit potato and shellfish oil
*   Strawberries flambéed with black pepper
*   Chocolate dessert (coulant or mousse)
</div>

The décor of the place was plain, but it made the food all the more vibrant. Everything we ate was cooked to perfection, and delicious. A simple poached egg and salad tasted unreal, and the meat on my shoulder of kid just fell off. I was amazed and mystified with the taste of kid, with a flavour of its own I couldn’t pin down what made it so different. The desserts were sublime, never have I tasted strawberries so good, and we savoured every bite of the chocolate.

On the way home we stopped outside Casa Batlló to relax in front of the lit up façade, now quiet and still in the night.

On our last day in Barcelona, we packed up and checked out at 12\. Leaving our luggage at the hotel, we took our final trip to Crusto. Ensaïmada for breakfast and some fine home-made pizza for lunch, sliced and wrapped. 

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/spain-cadaques-barcelona-324.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/spain-cadaques-barcelona-324.jpg)

First stop of the day, La Pedrera gift shop, to grab some Gaudí tile reproductions, a poster and tea towel (of course). Then on to La Sagrada Família, to work on our photography skills a little more and eat lunch in the pleasant surroundings of the cathedral and park (far enough away from the construction site whirr). Snap, snap, snap, we tried artistic compositions of the nativity façade, reflections in the lake and reflections in sunglasses included. The sun hot on our necks one last time, we’d escaped the sun burn monster.

Heading back, we spent an age in Vinçon, a department store filled with ingenious furniture and gadgets. Then one last stop at Cerveceria Catalana for Barcelona’s best tapas, before grabbing our bags, repacking them, chilling on the hotel roof by the jacuzzis, then casually heading down to the metro station.

Freshly purchased tickets in hand and out of breath after a mad dash, we sat on the train, waiting to go to the airport. “Is this train going to the airport?”, “no?”, quick! We jumped off before the doors closed, suitcases and all still intact.

The next train was the right one, and after a hike across the airport from the station to the EasyJet check in, we were shortly on our flight home to Gatwick and a not so sunny Brighton.
