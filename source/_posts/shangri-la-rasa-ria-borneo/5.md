Our last day at the Shangri-la. Although we weren’t flying to Borneo Rainforest Lodge until Thursday, we were checking out early to save ourselves some cash. Rather than stay overnight again (at some expense!), and get a 40 minute taxi to the airport at 4am in the morning, we decided to check out a day early. Instead we’d stay at the hotel all day, and get a taxi to a cheap hotel right next to the airport for one night, then fly out the next day — very early but without the long drive beforehand.

For our last breakfast we returned to Coast, for the free prosecco and bucks fizz. The eggs benedict came with two perfectly poached eggs that seemed to not stop oozing yolk. Despite Sam’s pancake, Nasi Lemak and buffet choices, she was so impressed she immediately ordered one too. Four breakfasts, why not?

The rest of the day was much the same as before, hammock swinging, poolside sunbathing, happy hour cocktails, fresh lime sodas, a very tight competitive game of boules, bird watching and sunset photography. Only this time we checked out at midday and paid for all amenities with cash. The Shangri la was an oasis of calm, a place to relax, eat fantastic food and worry only about the size of the hotel tab. A delightful slice of luxury and decadence.

## From luxury to jungle

We watched the sun set over the pristine sandy beach one last time, cocktails in hand, a band playing, the sky turning dark. And we looked forward to the final part of our Malaysia and Borneo holiday, when we’d travel into the depths of the jungle, come face to face with leeches and hopefully see some wild orangutans. Tomorrow we travel to the [Borneo Rainforest Lodge](/2014/05/borneo-rainforest-lodge/ "Borneo Rainforest Lodge").
