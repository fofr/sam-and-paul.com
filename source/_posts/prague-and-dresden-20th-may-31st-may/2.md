It’s now Friday afternoon, my commentary was cut short because we had to get off the train to Dresden. I’m now sitting in the delightful Lucerna music bar off Wenceslas square, listening to the live piano music  and drinking Bailey’s coffee and Darjeeling “Eilles” tea.

## Prague panoramas

On Sunday, after the Maltese Knights, we took the 11/22 trams to the castle for our second round of sightseeing, though at Malostranska we opted for a walk through the town, trekking up Nerudova and Uvoz for some spectacular panoramics. And despite the heat, we eventually reached Strahovska zahrada at the top.

Starving and exhausted, and after discarding copious tourist eateries, we settled on St Norbert’s brewery, within the grounds of the monastery. The “black beer” was gorgeous, so too was my mustard and honey barbecued pork — Sam wasn’t so keen on her goulash and dumplings. Norbert’s special white beer was also tasty. After purchasing a glass we walked towards the mock Eiffel tower, up more steep hills and through the woods. For 150Kc we climbed to the top, with Sam just about managing her vertigo. Stunning 360 degree views of Prague awaited, including the stadium and castle.

The climb down wasn’t so quick - the spiral staircase and downward views left Sam’s head spinning. With a thirst quenching coke we perused some enclosed gardens and descended the hill along a different path, around the hillside tram route and past the communist memorial, we crossed the river at Vitezna and passed the Narodni divaldo.

After a small tram mishap we were home, changed for the evening, and back out again, back to Mala Strana. We ate in a superbly decorated tavern, tables were fixed upside down on the ceiling and walls garnished with quirky paintings. Sam adored her roasted lamb parcel, my mixed grill was mediocre, although the opportunity to taste the excellent black ‘Kozel’ beer was a plus. They also charged for tap water and a starter offered as “as present”. C’est la vie.
