**But first, getting from Iguaçu Falls to Paraty via Sao Paulo and 24 hours of bus travel.**

On the national park bus we left the park, outside we waited for the sunday bus into town. In town, at the bus station we worked through the portugese-english language barrier to determine when the next bus to the ‘rodoviaria’ was, i.e. the large out of town bus stop for long distance travel.

Many conversations with Brazilians followed this pattern,

“Do you speak English?”
“Não, português?”,
“No”,
“Espanhol?”
“No”

At which point they lift their hands in the air and look exasperated. But then they always seemed to go out of their way to find someone that spoke English, or to help us as best they could. In this case we gestured with hand signals to work out the time and used fingers for numbers, before eventually an English speaker materialised and explained everything. Our bus arrived, we were starving but didn’t want to miss our coach.

Three buses down and we were ready for our 16 hour long sleeper bus to São Paulo; but not before some greasy spoon fast food from the only food outlet in the bus station. Bus stations are universally horrible. I had the weirdest pizza, I thought it was olives, peppers and sweetcorn, but it was processed chicken, peas and sweetcorn, no tomato.

We waited an hour or so for our bus, and passed the time with a bit of live football. We met an Australian biochemist travelling alone and on the same bus as us. She was half way through a year long world trip and had even booked a trip out to Antarctica.

Boarding time at last! We locked up our bags, weighed them, tagged them and threw them in the hold. We showed our passports and tickets and boarded our ‘leito’ sleeper bus. The seats were like armchairs; wide and comfortable with a handy fold-down leg rest. On an old CRT screen at the front were movies in Portuguese; ‘I am Legend’, Harry Potter and ‘Night at the Museum 2’.

We set off slowly, heading out of Foz do Iguaçu onto the two lane highway and eastwards. The sun began to set and we had a roadside view of Brazil, through rolling green hills with rich red soils, through small towns and passing full to the brim churches, overflowing with people praising God. We stopped at Londrina for another pick-up and the bus filled up. The sun disappeared and the road beckoned.

Every four hours we stopped for a walkabout, food and a toilet break, with the occasional stop in-between where we couldn’t work out what was going on. The service stations give you a slip with menu items when you enter. You tick off the things you buy, and pay on exit. From a large roadside canteen we ate breadcrumbed fried chicken and lamb koftas, avoiding the strange looking per kilo buffet.

Don the eye masks, the ear plugs and the headphones and we’re set for some uncomfortable travel sleeping. We managed to get about four hours each, perhaps more, it’s hard to tell. Apparently in the night we stopped for a ‘police search’, our Australian friend had her bags searched and was asked if she was carrying cocaine.

At 6am we were woken from our slumber for another food stop. In the thick early morning fog we tried some breakfast. This place looked nicer, so we ordered some coffee, what a terrible mistake. A weird chocolaty sludge came with a centimetre thick encrusted milk topping. I tried to scrape it off, but it just left huge chunks of yuck in the drink. Just thinking about it I’m turning pale. That coffee made the last four hours that little bit more queasy.

The journey into São Paulo took an age, the huge concrete city surrounded us as we chugged through early morning Monday rush hour. The city seemed more affluent than Rio, at least from the small slice we saw. On the pillars of huge overhead highways were intricate graffiti, not unlike what you might see in Brighton. Artful and vibrant.

90 minutes late we reached the rodoviaria. We picked up our next bus ticket and waited for the fifth and final bus in a bus station cafe, reclining on a leather sofa next to a piano and our large blue and red backpacks. Happy to be off the bus, we shared a ciabatta and freshly made fruit juice. The guy at the bar was excited to try out his English, and Sam had a conversation with him, as she loves to do.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/IMG_3834.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/IMG_3834.JPG)

Before we knew it we were boarding a regular Costa Verde coach towards Paraty; this journey would only take six hours. It was much the same; road after road, cars overtaking us, a service station stop (with some goats and baby chicks), reclining seats and leg rests. I listened to Joni Mitchell and Sam tried to sleep.

As we neared the coast the route grew hilly, with gorgeous sea views. The bus accelerated around U-turn corners, down towards the sea, through coastal villages, over their belly-in-mouth speed bumps, and back up the hill, over to the next village with more of the same. We endured three hours of stuffy queasiness travelling through Caraguátuba and Ubatuba. It was almost too much for Sam, and she tried to ignore it, but the rocking and swaying was ceaseless. In the meantime my appetite returned and I gobbled up all the snacks we’d been lugging around with us since Rio.

Fortunately we had a service station stop, a break from the movement and a chance to recover. Afterwards the bus wasn’t so bad, and I slept the last two hours.

At 6pm on Monday, about 27 hours after setting off, we arrived in Paraty, thoroughly exhausted and needing a shower. We grabbed a fixed rate 20 reais taxi with a one armed driver to our hotel, Eliconial, a short walk outside of town and on Praia do Jabaquara.

All we wanted to do was check-in, but the welcoming French man, Yvan, complicated matters by pushing us towards staying more than one night at a better rate in a better chalet, along with a story about the standard rooms being unavailable the following night. Our intention was to stay longer, but we wanted to scope the place out first. Whatever, let’s do the good one, it was only a few reais more.

Inside we had a living room, a kitchen and a bedroom, all packed into a small space. The room felt dark, but then we had the shutters closed to stop the mosquitos getting in. There was a pleasant swimming pool and jacuzzi, and Heliconia plants are everywhere. By the pool is a green parrot with clipped wings, under the seats cats lie in the shade, and there’s a dalmatian puppy running around too, looking cute for all the guests. It’s a fairly small place, with only about eight rooms.

“It’s safe here, you can go anywhere at night, even walk along the beach”, were welcomed words. Having spent so much time in Rio (and on the buses) stressing about safety and valuables this came as a great relief.

A quick snooze on the firm beds, a wash, and we were out looking for a decent cooked meal. The guys recommended a pizzeria down the road, Sereia do Mar hostel. Amongst the wooden beams, the nearby beach and the blasting 90s music, we sat down and ordered all you can eat pizza.

This place was vibrant and filled with young interesting people, even if it felt a bit like a surfers paradise. Two caipirinhas for ten reais was the cheapest we’d seen, and the pizza was cheap and very tasty too. Perfect, let’s have another two cocktails.

Then we stumbled home, a couple of dogs following us around, back passed the football pitch where kids had been playing, some empty looking pousadas and a couple of beach side huts, to the end of the road and our hidden hotel.

The forecast for the week looked ominous, thunderstorms and rain every day until the end. Looking at the BBC weather map I could see a huge rain cloud making it’s way from the south, towards costa verde, Paraty and Rio. Hrmph.

But in the morning, when we opened the shutters and went out for breakfast the skies were clear and things looked promising. We ate the usual; coffee, cake, toast and some fresh fruit, and met a few of the other guests in the hotel, a couple from New York on their honeymoon and expecting a baby, they’d been here a night already and were going out on a boat trip.

Today we didn’t have much planned, but we wanted to see the old town and generally just have a look around. We headed into Paraty via a beachside wander on Praia do Jabaquara, wandering out as far as we could paddle, looking out onto the calm sea, and surrounded by rainforest covered hills. The sun was hot as we climbed the small mound between us and town, then back down, onto cobbled streets, over a small river and into Paraty.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-180.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-180.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-181.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-181.jpg)

The old town is a criss crossing network of cobbled streets, each building painted white with brightly coloured window frames, it’s remarkably photogenic. Cars aren’t allowed in and only horse and cart navigate the uneven streets, amongst a few stray dogs.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-188.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-188.jpg)

The town is hip and bohemian, and between restaurants and the odd tourist shop are fascinating art galleries and sculptures. We wandered down Rua do Comercio and tried to make a note of where interesting shops were, but it’s labyrinthine and difficult to find anything again.

We stopped for a can of cooling Guaraná Antarctica, and as we recovered from the heat the clouds started to come over, and soon, before midday, the sun was gone. At the edge of town we found Paraty’s famous landmark, Igreja Santa Rita, which looked fantastic against the swirling dark clouds.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-183.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-183.jpg)

We skirted the south of town. At the port all the tourist boats had left for the day, and the place was quiet. Further round was another church, Capela de NS das Dores. I left Sam with the camera to snap the scenery and walked ahead in search of a comfy bench.

An Indian couple from California were taking pictures across the river. As with most travellers in Brazil it’s easy to strike up a conversation, and again we shared stories of our travels, waxing lyrical about Iguaçu falls, which they were heading to next. It seems popping over to the Argentinean side isn’t so easy with an Indian passport.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/IMG_4787.JPG)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/IMG_4787.JPG)

Back into town, I tried my hand at photographing textures, which rarely come out as expected, before making our way into ‘new Paraty’, with modern roads and shops it’s very much like any other Brazilian town. We found the banks and ATMs, only one accepted European cards, 40 minutes from our hotel.

We stopped at a per kilo buffet restaurant for lunch and piled on the tasty barbecued steak, lamb stew, potatoes, vegetables and rice. At the checkered plastic tablecloth we sipped cold bottled coke and picked at fish bones.

Back in town Sam found an English speaking Cachaça expert in a room filled to the ceiling with expensive varieties. The charming assistant poured out free samples of un-aged (used in cocktails) and ten year matured (for drinking straight) Cachaça; it’s 38%—48% and made from fresh sugarcane juice that is fermented and distilled. Paraty is a renowned Cachaça producer and each year it holds a Cachaça festival. There’s a distillery and tour out of town but it was too far for us. We bought a bottle of Cachaça Coqueiro and tipsily meandered home.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-190.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-190.jpg)

At Eliconial the jacuzzi beckoned and we relaxed amongst the warm bubbles until our hands wrinkled. We made the decision to stay here for the rest of our trip, and booked the remaining nights before heading out for dinner. An owl watched over us from the telephone lines.

That night we ate at the recommended “La Marguerite”. Inside a guy with guitar played his tunes and covers, interspersed by music videos of the Lighthouse Family (there’s so much 90s music in Brazil, it’s very odd). Our waiter had the widest smiliest Brazilian grin you’d ever see, as he took our wine and food order. Outside a marching band passed by.

This place had everything except gourmet food. The decor, atmosphere and style was sumptuous (including the Mona Lisa made from a favela oil painting), but we left lamenting why they’d battered Sam’s prawns and how in a meal with pork and lamb there was no sauce or vegetables. Alas, the wine was good and our dessert wonderful; the waiter flambéed banana with brandy at our table in a pan engulfed with blue flame. The hot sweet alcoholic fruit was yummy.

On our exit the heavens were open, and rain battered the cobblestone. We tried our hotel umbrella but it broke and we dived into a taxi. Our driver took us home to the tune of Gilbert O’Sullivan’s “Alone Again (Naturally)”.

Once again there was a forecast of rain, but the skies were blue and everything was tropical and beautiful. At breakfast we enjoyed coffee and scrambled egg (they wouldn’t do fried) but heard a mighty crash from one of the rooms, like a huge vase had broken. We didn’t think much of it until I returned to find the sink had fallen out and smashed on the floor. Concrete shards covered the floor.

We moved our stuff to the smaller chalet opposite (the one we were told wasn’t available). And that was the last we heard of ‘the sink incident’, it became a bit of an elephant in the room, even though it didn’t cause us any further hassle. Some guys checked in later in the week so we can only assume they fixed it swiftly.

But we wouldn’t let this ruin our day. Out, along the beach and down into town, we were at the local bus station for the 11am bus to Trindade. The bus was heaving with school kids, and as it swerved and stopped suddenly we clung tightly to the loosened metal poles. Along route BR101, it took about an hour to reach Praia da Trindade, but only R$3 each (versus a guided tour for R$40 each).

Trindade was recommended by Rob in Rio as a quiet ‘less touristy’ place to stay. We considered finding a hostel here, but given the forecast we figured we’d want a little more than beaches and rain. But today it was gorgeous and we set about the ‘three beaches’ trek, starting off in the wrong direction and taking an unplanned hike into the hills.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-195.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-195.jpg)

A narrow wooden trail climbed upwards through the rainforest. Wary of snakes hidden in the undergrowth, we clambered onwards to find waterfalls and a large fresh water pool. At the back of the pool a smooth slanted rock had a trickle of water flowing over it, forming a perfect natural water slide.

Sam swum across, climbed up and shuffled towards the slide. Then before she was ready the trickle of water grabbed her and she slid downwards, sideways, doing a half turn and splashing into the pool below with a shout of excitement. Again, again!

Further up was another pool, deeper and with a raging waterfall. Sam stood beneath it and shrieked as it crashed over her.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-192.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-192.jpg)

Back at the beach, where large blue crabs scuttled passed us, we had lunch at a beachside hut and continued with the beach trek. Through a river we waded, and climbed up onto and over a jutting hill, the home of luminescent ladybirds. On the other side a long empty crescent beach stretched out in front of us. Huge waves crashed on the shore, and the sand was fine and soft.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-197.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-197.jpg)

Along the beach were a couple of secluded hostels. We stopped beneath a tree for a rest, Sam had a nap and I watched the leaf-cutter ants perform their arduous journey up and down the trunk, driving on the left. With my head down on the sand all I could hear were the sounds of the sea, the waves and the birds.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-198.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-198.jpg)

An hour or so later we carried on, climbing over some rocks to find the start of the final trail. Up another dirt path we walked, around to a large natural swimming pool in the sea. Huge rocks formed a circle around a small bay, protecting it from the sea and creating somewhere awesome to swim.

After a swim we headed back to Trindade to catch the 7pm bus home. Sam’s desire to see a hummingbird was growing, it seemed every time she turned away one popped up, hummed around a flower and disappeared again. She kept missing them. The first time you see one you can’t help but smile.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-201.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-201.jpg)

Before the bus, we coo’ed at the cutest of baby chicks. Their owner came out to say hello and we had a lovely evening chat. Surprisingly, based on the experiences we’d had so far, she had good English, and when we couldn’t understand she wrote numbers or symbols in the sand. We held the chicks and she pointed out that the boy chicks have much smaller wings.

We spent the rest of the bus waiting time finding somewhere to wash our hands. We went into a café separately, and independently asked the owner to use her sink, when I asked the second time she freaked out, but her cakes were yummy!

Back in Paraty we searched for a restaurant, Banana Da Terra. It looked great, but we were cautious, the food was pricey. We skipped the couvert and shared a starter. Sam ordered prawns again, and I went for something completely different, ginger rice with duck. The food came out, and at last, we had gourmet dining in Brazil, it was delightful. After a passion fruit caipirinha and a long conversation explaining the named plates on the walls, we went home, via a night time stroll on the beach.

<!--nextpage-->

Thursday was forecast to be the hottest, it was also meant to rain, but again the rain didn’t show up. We played with the marmosets at the hotel. They jumped from tree to tree and I tried to snap a midair shot. We talked work, internet, and life with the couple opposite us; the guy had lived in Brazil for a few years, but now lived in London, working with internet start-ups in Old Street, which was too much of a coincidence for my liking.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-202.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-202.jpg)

We didn’t do much and it was lovely. We walked along the beach, swum in the sea and bathed in the sun. We had lunch at La Luna; tasty steak and fish with the usual beans, salad, rice and chip sides. The steak in Brazil is so big, tasty and cheap, but you can’t help feeling somewhat guilty that you’re supporting the deforestation. Next to us two dogs gave us starving puppy eyes.

The bar was right on the sea front and after eating we lay down on an outdoor bed, watched the sea and listened to music, music perfect for sitting beneath a coconut tree.

It seems the sea had washed off our sunscreen, and our shoulders were emanating heat, they’d turned a wonderful shade of red. The hoteliers found it hilarious.

In town we tried to do some shopping, but when it came to getting cash none of the ATMs in any of the three banks would give us any. We tried four cards from four different banks, Visa, Amex and MasterCard, all failed, “cartao no localazido”. This could be bad. But when we bought our bus tickets for the return to Rio the cards worked in their PIN machine, so we could at least buy things with plastic.

And that’s how it was for the rest of the holiday, the ATM’s never worked again, we changed up the spare dollars we had and got a cash advance from the hotel to tide us over. We found others with the same problem.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-209.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-209.jpg)

That night we ate at a posh looking black-and-white Italian restaurant, we’d been eyeing it up all week. Inside a charming but timid waiter nervously tried his English, and at the back, near an open courtyard and the cool night air we ordered. I took the opportunity to try an Acerola juice, scrumptious but hard to describe, with it I had palmito and pesto ravioli.

We walked home along the beach again, watching a drunken group of travellers in front of us, as they weaved about the road; thick English, Australian and American accents permeating the air as they searched for an open bar. We quietly passed them by, and resumed the nighttime stroll. The waves were calm and the breeze cool, crabs scuttled by, and a friendly dog guided us home, through long grass, to the road and the hotel’s muddy driveway. Goodbye little doggy.

<!--nextpage-->

Everyone in the hotel had been on the boat trip, and with a day to spare we did it too. In town we climbed onto the boat and waited to leave. It seemed like good value, R$25 each for most of the day. It turned out the charges were hidden; lunch, scuba rental, desserts, drinks and fruit - the prices added up to over R$100\. And as boat trips go, it was lacklustre.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-211.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-211.jpg)

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-212.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-212.jpg)

Ten of us, on a boat that could hold 25, chugged out to an island for a spot of scuba and swim, then along to a large island with a rocky perch. Here we struggled to see monkeys and iguanas, our captain unwilling to take us closer, our eyes strained, we could make out golden brown shapes moving in the trees, but soon they were gone.

While we waited for the monkeys the glorious sunshine disappeared behind grey cloud. Beach time was substituted for more swimming time. We ate a cooked dinner on the boat; fish, salad and potatoes, none too shoddy and before we knew it we were heading back to Paraty again.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-213.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-213.jpg)

Despite all this we had a great time conversing with our fellow tourists, cariocas from Rio, down for the weekend, a well travelled woman from Buenos Aires, a scrawny brown woman from Miami and a small family. We spent most of the afternoon talking about cultural differences, healthcare, taxes, corruption, house prices and all that really serious stuff; “If it works in Brazil, you’ve paid for it twice”, they said, talking about privatised motorways.

The young couple from Rio, a lawyer and graphic designer, that had met in Barcelona, explained how Rio was attempting to clean up its act for the olympics and world cup. And of course we talked about football; I was embarrassed to find the Brazilians knew more about the current Premier league table than I did, and I knew nothing about Brazilian teams.

Back on dry land, we said our goodbyes and tried the ATMs once more. No luck. At the hotel we warmed up the jacuzzi and relaxed, we were going home soon and didn’t feel like doing anything. We shared the jacuzzi with another Brazilian couple, this time from Sao Paulo. Again, down for the weekend, we talked about life, and work and their disabled dog.

For our last night out we ate at the nearby Luna again, it’d been so good the first time we couldn’t pass it up, but had to be sparing with our cash. I didn’t think it was so great this time around, the waiter was arrogant about how great his food was, but Sam agreed, and she loved her fried fish server with tropical fruit. We lubricated the evening with some more Caipirinhas, oh how the sweet alcohol, sugar and lime mix perfectly, my favourite cocktail, but so intoxicating.

<!--nextpage-->

And so our holiday to Brazil comes to an end. We checked out the next morning, with our bags full, lifted onto our backs and ready to go. A taxi to the bus station and then a four hour Costa Verde bus into Rio, then a taxi to the airport. Wise Sam, guided by her hungry tummy, urged us to eat before going through security, and upstairs in the airport we enjoyed our final brazilian steak and chips, and I took the last chance to try a capiroska cocktail.

[![](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/small/brazil-214.jpg)](http://host.trivialbeing.org/up/brazil-214.jpg)

Through the metal detectors, and out the other side, Sam was right, there would’ve been nowhere to eat here, and we passed the hour by shopping for trinkets; a flip flop keyring, unhelpfully priced in USD. The pathetic cocktail kits were laughable.

Eventually we boarded the uncomfortable bum numbing 14 hour flight to Amsterdam, the Brazilian buses were much better. I rotted my brain with Transformers 3, as Sam discussed pesticides and herbicides with a Swedish scientist sat next to her. In Amsterdam  we ran for our connection, and boarded an old Fokker jet, so old it still had ash trays in each seat. And soon we were circling London, flying past the towering Shard construction site, over the new Olympic park and down into Heathrow, ready to return to real life and the very busy week ahead.

Wow, Brazil had been fantastic and fascinating. The flora and fauna sublime and plentiful, the people so friendly and interesting, the scenery simply magnificent; from the sugarloaf to the waterfalls and the mega-cities, Brazil is mind-blowing.

We want to return to see more, we didn’t have time for the Pantanal, Bonito, the Amazon or Salvador. Seeing something living in the wild, even a fleeting glance, is so thrilling we're bound to explore more.
