## Songkran, day two

Wednesday was much the same, day two of Songkran and the water festival continued.

Post-breakfast swimming, relaxing and a little bit of sleeping. Our honeymoon in Thailand was almost over. Our first taste of Asia had been incredible; from the tropical fruits, islands and beaches to the spicy curries, tuk-tuks and friendly hotel staff. We had paradise, bliss, adventure and a little bit of magic.

Heading out into the city one last time, we prepared for more water fighting madness. We threw buckets of water over trucks with perfect accuracy (or narrowly missing by several foot), reloaded with ice cold water, discarded water guns like Neo and got utterly and completely drenched. Donning straw/banana leaf hats we made our last few attacks and walking back to the hotel (squelch, squelch), our hearts were contented.

At the night market we made our final purchases - mango wood carvings, food and earrings included.

## Goodbye Chiang Mai

Then it was time to say good bye. Goodbye Chiang Mai with your Wats and moat; bye bye Rimping Village, bye Mr Tommy, with your great big smile; bye to the restaurant staff that knew our orders, prepared with a smile and even shared recipes; bye bye reception where we shared stories, made friends and learnt a bit of culture; bye bye guests and friends.

Bye bye lizards, mosquitos, jasmine, lotus plants, rice and noodles. Bye bye Thailand, with all your charm and beauty. We’ll be back.
