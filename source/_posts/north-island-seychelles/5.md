## Wildlife on North Island

Aside from the turtles and the tortoises, there's a small but interesting mix of other creatures that make up the island's food chain. Small, because it's an island, over 4 weeks I saw much of what the island had to offer, terrestrially at least. There are no land mammals, rats have been eradicated, and there's nothing in way of nocturnal animals (save the emerging green turtles).

### Birds

#### Moorhens

You can't travel far without hearing the crying calls of a juvenile moorhen. Moorhens dominate the plateau, there's nothing predating them, so their numbers keep growing. On the grasses they fight and squabble, vying for food and presumably territory. From the buggy I often saw small groups of them fleeing the roadside into the foliage, their tale feathers twitching as they run.

They like to eat from the myna bird traps, trapping themselves until a volunteer comes to free them.

#### Zebra doves

Alongside the moorhens are one of my new favourite birds, the barred ground dove, or zebra dove. It's a tiny dove with subtle black stripes and blue-ish face. It's incredibly cute, and the males greet each other with a delightful little dance. Many times I'd be sitting outside the volunteer house, reading David Attenborough's biography, and these little things would wander around by my feet, coo-ing, and calling to each other. Fabulous.

#### Seychelles sunbirds

A slightly less common sight, but not rare, are the seychelles sunbirds. A pair of these could occasionally be seen flitting near the house, drinking nectar from a nearby hibiscus. Like hummingbirds, they hover briefly in the air, fly swiftly and change direction quickly; always fascinating to observe.

#### Green-backed heron

Spotted by the house as well, it seems the house is a birding hotspot. This inquisitive looking bird poked around in the leaves looking for a meal. When it catches sight of you it stares with its beady eyes, down its long beak, before squawking and flying off. I saw a couple flying up and down the beach in the early morning when doing beach patrols.

#### Common myna

The common myna, or indian myna, are everywhere, despite continued efforts to eradicate them. As mentioned, they're an aggressive invasive species that harm other birds. Despite this they remain interesting to observe, I rarely saw them on the ground, often nipping down for a quick meal before returning to the treetops.

#### Red fodys

An exotic, but not invasive, species found here is the madagascar red fody. Only a couple of times did I see the delightful bright red male, once on spa hill, then again on bernica. But around the bistro there was a group of active females and what looked like juvenile males; birds that were showing some signs of turning red.

#### Common whimbrel

CJ told me this is a migratory bird, but that some have stayed behind. They have long legs and a curving beak, they remind me of a lifelike curlew model I have at home. Against the dying grass in the dry season they have perfect camouflage, and would always fly away [squealing](http://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/whimbrel) (an awful screeching squeal) before I could get close enough for a photo.

#### Common sandpiper

I found one of these regularly patrolling petit anse, camouflaged against the sand and rocks, its disguise was always given away by its bobbing tale. It has a habit of flying to whichever end of the beach you aren’t on.

#### White-tailed tropic bird


#### Seychelles white-eye

#### Seychelles kestrel


### Fruit bats

The skies are relatively quiet, the birds stay on the ground for the most part, there's nothing to predate them, so they’re comfortable walking and foraging. Something does fly high, with a half-metre wingspan, but it's not a bird; North Island, much like Silhouette, has a population of seychelles fruit bats – they're active in the day, and when not flying between trees they hang upside down munching on takamaka fruit.
