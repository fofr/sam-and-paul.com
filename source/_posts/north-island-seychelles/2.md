## Volunteer activities

Each day is broken up into 4 loose slots; two morning sessions, two afternoon sessions and 2h30 for lunch – it's so hot at midday all you can do is rest. The morning sessions begin at 7am, which sounds early but is the nicest time of day, half an hour after dawn, when the air is still comfortably cool.

"Island time" means the slots don't last as long as they should, or start later, or they get swapped around, or there's simply no activity to do; it's all very relaxed, well, until something overruns or someone can't do something because they don't have a buggy, or a GPS, or some other vital tool – and then everyone gets tense and you realise how poorly it's managed.

### Turtle patrol

This is my favourite activity on North Island, and it's the first activity every morning. After breakfast we take the buggy, and split up, heading out to each of the islands four beaches. Our job is to walk the beach, to see if any turtles have emerged overnight; we take with us a bag for rubbish, and a pack of tools incase a turtle has visited; a log book, a GPS recorder, a tape measure, and a marker pen. (There's one pack for four people and four beaches, so if there's lots of activity it can take a while).

If a turtle has emerged it's very obvious, there will be a track that comes from the sea, probably leading to a body pit or a nest site, and then back again. In August it's predominantly green turtles that are nesting, the island has both green turtles and hawksbill turtles, but typically when one is laying, the other isn't; that's what the data collected by volunteers shows.

A green turtle can weigh about 200-300kg (whereas the hawksbill is closer to 70kg), and it leaves tracks about 1m across. We use the tape measure to get an indication of their size. Green turtles typically emerge overnight, presumably so their large body can stay cool and they don't get caught out in the hot sun.

When they find a spot they dig to create a body pit and an egg chamber, up to a metre deep, to lay their eggs. Green turtles lay 100 or so eggs at once, not all of them fertilised. While laying eggs the turtles are in a trance like state, they continue until all eggs have been laid. This is the point at which a turtle can be tagged with a titanium metal identifier. After digging and laying they cover the eggs and spend a long time disguising where the nest is. They throw sand in all directions and make disturbances in the sand. The disguise is mostly to prevent their eggs from being predated by crabs. Crabs swarm around disturbances in sand, looking for a meal. Around many nests there are crab holes, but they don't always find the eggs; this predation is natural and is not prevented. Sometimes you can find the egg shells lying on the beach where crabs have gotten to them and dug them up.

When we find a nest we mark it with wooden stakes, and on a coconut write the species of turtle, the nest number and the date. Then we save a GPS location for it.

Some turtle digs get abandoned and we don't find a nest – the sand might be too soft, and keep falling back in, preventing the pit from being deep enough, or it might have obstructions like plant roots, in these cases a turtle will usually abandon its effort and return to the sea without laying. One particular turtle however made a mammoth effort, she climbed the beach and began digging, but the site wasn't right, so moved on, she made 5 attempts, and left a turtle track over 100m long; the poor turtle must have been exhausted – at one point, after 3 digs, it looked like she was heading back to sea, but she doubles back again to try twice more, all unsuccessful; poor thing. We still save a GPS location, but mark it as an emergence rather than a nest.

#### Seeing a green turtle

I was fortunate enough to see a green turtle on west beach. After an evening of star photography (the milky way is astounding here), I joined Robyn and we sat on the beach and waited. Beneath the moonlight and stars, we watched for the emergence of a vague dark object from the ocean depths, like witnessing an ancient  ritual we don't fully comprehend. For hours we watched the waves, every coconut or rock starts to look like a turtle. We didn't see anything so headed to Honeymoon beach to try our luck there, no turtles.

At 10:30pm we were going to call it a night, but now that the guests had left Sunset Bar at the far end of west beach, it was worth looking here too. Walking along the beach we heard a distant noise, it sounded like something was digging or pushing sand, and we were immediately excited. Following the sea along the beach we found a turtle trail, which didn't have a return path – it was definitely a turtle and it was definitely still on the beach.

Green turtles are sensitive to light, so we didn't use torches or flash photography. Typically the moon had now set, so there was complete darkness. The only light was coming from the milky way high above us, the shining heart of our galaxy illuminating nature doing its thing. Above the turtle three shooting stars passed by.

From the trail we listened intently for the turtle's activity, the digging had stopped as soon as we arrived. We hoped this meant it was laying, we followed the tracks up the beach, stopping short of the vegetation and keeping a respectful distance, as we'd been told. We didn't want to disturb the turtle, it needed to finish its laying and then disguise the eggs. We waited patiently, without moving, for an hour as it pushed sand about, with the occasional noise of her smacking a coconut. In the complete darkness the crabs couldn't see us, one particularly large one inched closer, we had a coconut to scare it away, just in case.

Without any warning, a large dark object appeared from the vegetation and begun moving toward us. We kept our lights off and strained our eyes to see this magnificent creature. It edged ever closer to me, and passed to my left within 2m, stopping to rest right besides me, for a moment it looked at me, inquisitively, then it carried on, 2 strokes then rest, 2 strokes then rest, all the way down to the sea. We quietly followed it, sticking to its blind spots, and watched as it swum away, another shooting star punctuated its disappearance.

### Tortoises

There are over 80 tortoises on the island, with three dominant males; Patrick, Harry and Brutus. By the volunteer house there's a pen for the young, who would otherwise be at risk of getting hit by a buggy driving too fast, they’re about 2 years old.

As a volunteer it's our job to regularly find as many of the tortoises as we can. When found we note the number on their rear, GPS tag their location, and indicate their current activity – eating, resting, "active", etc. Number 38 likes to hang around the volunteer house, often drinking from the leaky tap out the back. The numbers are etched into their shells, but many of them are illegible, which means the data collected will have errors – eg 14 and 24 could be misread as 4.

### Snorkelling

The reefs are ideal for snorkelling, but the activity depends on the weather, the sea's roughness and visibility in the water. While snorkelling is often seen as a recreational activity for volunteers, there is some work here too; there's a compact camera with a waterproof case that should be taken out and used to photograph the variety of fish species around the coral. Back at the environment office the species can then be identified and saved in a spreadsheet along with their pictures.

As a poor swimmer, and with waves that often break above my head, I opted out of the snorkelling – one particular wave flattened me and I almost lost flippers and mask. I'm not confident enough to swim out to the coral without a lifeguard or anyone on watch, in case I get into trouble. This is kind of a bummer, as water is the best way to cool down in the stifling heat, and the island's best wildlife is in the surrounding reefs. Many volunteers also take part in dive training, and some have taken the open water exam here. But that's all too advanced for me; I'd prefer calm water with a shallow gradient to find my bearings, or a pool.

### Coconut removal

### Indian Myna eradication

While not a volunteer activity for us, this was a big conservation project taking place while we were there. And yes, eradication means killing.

The Indian Myna bird is an invasive species, originally introduced to help catch bugs when the island was a coconut plantation. They are aggressive birds and actively harass many struggling endemic species; for instance the seychelles wren; the myna will attack the bird and peck its head, causing brain damage, and it will turf out eggs from its nest. To encourage sea bird species to return, and to begin reintroduction programmes for other at risk birds, the mynas must first be removed. It's not logistically possible to remove them from the island and take them somewhere else; they are humanely killed instead.

This project has its own dedicated volunteers, two students for one month, and now two new volunteers who will be on the island for 6 months.
